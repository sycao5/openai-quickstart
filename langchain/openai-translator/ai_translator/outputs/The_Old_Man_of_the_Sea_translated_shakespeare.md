The Old Man and the Sea
By Ernest Hemingway

To Charlie Shribner
And
To Max Perkins

He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone
eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him.
But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him that the old man was
now definitely and finally salao, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone
at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish the first week. It made the
boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went
down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that
was furled around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it looked
like the flag of permanent defeat.

The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck. The
brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the
tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his
hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of
these scars were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.

Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the
sea and were cheerful and undefeated.

"Santiago," the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from where the skiff was
hauled up. "I could go with you again. We've made some money."

The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.

"No," the old man said. "You're with a lucky boat. Stay with them."

"But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we caught big
ones every day for three weeks."

"I remember," quoth the old man. "I know thou didst not leave me because thou doubted."
"'Twas papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him."
"I know," the old man quoth. "It is quite normal."
"He hath not much faith."
"No," the old man quoth. "But we have. Hast we not?"
"Aye," the boy quoth. "Can I offer thee a beer on the Terrace and then we shall take the stuff home."
"Why not?" the old man quoth. "Between fishermen."
They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made jest of the old man and he was not angry. Others, of the elder fishermen, looked at him and were sad. But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and of what they had seen. The successful fishermen of that day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for salting.
When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark factory; but today there was only the faint edge of the odour because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
"Santiago," the boy quoth.
"Aye," the old man quoth. He was holding his glass and thinking of many years ago.
"Can I go out to get sardines for thee for tomorrow?"
"Nay. Go and play baseball. I can still row and Rogelio will throw the net."
"I would like to go. If I cannot fish with thee. I would like to serve in some way."
"Thou bought me a beer," the old man quoth. "Thou art already a man."
"How old was I when thou first took me in a boat?"
"Five and thou nearly were killed when I brought the fish in too green and he nearly tore the boat to pieces. Canst thou remember?"
"I can remember the tail slapping and banging and the thwart breaking and the noise of the clubbing. I can remember thou throwing me into the bow where the wet coiled lines were and feeling the whole boat shiver and the noise of thou clubbing him like chopping a tree down and the sweet blood smell all over me."
"Canst thou really remember that or did I just tell it to thee?"

"I remember everything from when we first went together."
The old man looked at him with his sun-burned, confident loving eyes.
"If thou wert mine own son, I would take thee out and gamble," he said. "But thou art thy father's and thy mother's, and thou art in a lucky boat."
"May I fetch the sardines? I know where I can procure four baits as well."
"I have mine left from today. I have preserved them in salt within the box."
"Allow me to acquire four fresh ones."
"One," the old man said. His hope and his confidence had never waned. But now they were rejuvenating, like a rising breeze.
"Two," the boy said.
"Two," the old man agreed. "Thou didst not pilfer them?"
"I would," the boy said. "But I purchased these."
"Thank thee," the old man said. He was too simple to ponder when he had achieved humility. But he knew he had attained it, and he knew it was not disgraceful and carried no loss of true pride.
"Morrow shall be a good day with this current," he said.
"Whither art thou going?" the boy asked.
"Far out, to return when the wind shifts. I desire to be out ere the light doth break."
"I shall endeavor to persuade him to venture far out," the boy said. "Then, if thou dost hook something truly immense, we can come to thy aid."
"He doth not relish toil too far out."
"Nay," the boy said. "But I shall spy something that he cannot, such as a bird at work, and entice him to pursue the dolphin."
"Are his eyes so feeble?"
"He is nigh unto blind."
"'Tis strange," the old man said. "He never went turtle-ing. That is what doth impair the eyes."
"But thou didst turtle for years off the Mosquito Coast, and thine eyes are sound."
"I am a peculiar old man."
"But art thou now strong enough for a truly colossal fish?"
"I deem so. And there are many stratagems."
"Let us bear the gear homeward," the boy said. "So I may fetch the cast net and pursue the sardines."
They gathered the equipment from the boat. The old man bore the mast upon his shoulder.

and the boy carried the wooden boat with the coiled, hard-braided brown lines, the gaff
and the harpoon with its shaft. The box with the baits was under the stern of the skiff
along with the club that was used to subdue the big fish when they were brought
alongside. No one would steal from the old man but it was better to take the sail and the
heavy lines home as the dew was bad for them and, though he was quite sure no local
people would steal from him, the old man thought that a gaff and a harpoon were
needless temptations to leave in a boat.
They walked up the road together to the old man’s shack and went in through its
open door. The old man leaned the mast with its wrapped sail against the wall and the
boy put the box and the other gear beside it. The mast was nearly as long as the one room
of the shack. The shack was made of the tough budshields of the royal palm which are
called guano and in it there was a bed, a table, one chair, and a place on the dirt floor to
cook with charcoal. On the brown walls of the flattened, overlapping leaves of the sturdy
fibered [15] guano there was a picture in color of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and another
of the Virgin of Cobre. These were relics of his wife. Once there had been a tinted
photograph of his wife on the wall but he had taken it down because it made him too
lonely to see it and it was on the shelf in the corner under his clean shirt.
"What doth thou have to eat?" the boy asked.
"A pot of yellow rice with fish. Dost thou want some?"
"Nay. I shall eat at home. Dost thou want me to make the fire?"
"Nay. I shall make it later on. Or I may eat the rice cold."
"May I take the cast net?"
"Of course."
There was no cast net and the boy remembered when they had sold it. But they went
through
this fiction every day. There was no pot of yellow rice and fish and the boy knew this
too. "Eighty-five is a lucky number," the old man said. "How wouldst thou like to see me
bring one in that dressed out over a thousand pounds?" "I'll get the cast net and go for
sardines. Wilt thou sit in the sun in the doorway?"
"Yes. I have yesterday's paper and I will read the baseball." The boy did not
know whether yesterday's paper was a fiction too. But the old man brought it out from
under the bed.
"Perico gave it to me at the bodega," he explained. "I'll be back when I have the
sardines. I'll keep thine and mine together on ice and we can share them in the morning.
When I come back thou canst tell me about the baseball."
"The Yankees cannot lose."
"But I fear the Indians of Cleveland."

---

The Old Man and the Sea Asiaing.com
"Have faith in the Yankees, my son. Think of the great DiMaggio."
"I fear both the Tigers of Detroit and the Indians of Cleveland."
"Be careful, or you will fear even the Reds of Cincinnati and the White Sax of Chicago."
"You study it and tell me when I come back."
"Do you think we should buy a terminal of the lottery with an eighty-five? Tomorrow is the eighty-fifth day."
"We can do that," the boy said. "But what about the eighty-seven of your great record?"
[17] "It could not happen twice. Do you think you can find an eighty-five?"
"I can order one."
"One sheet. That's two dollars and a half. Who can we borrow that from?"
"That's easy. I can always borrow two dollars and a half."
"I think perhaps I can too. But I try not to borrow. First you borrow. Then you beg."
"Keep warm, old man," the boy said. "Remember we are in September."
"The month when the great fish come," the old man said. "Anyone can be a fisherman in May."
"I go now for the sardines," the boy said.
When the boy came back, the old man was asleep in the chair, and the sun was down.
The boy took the old army blanket off the bed and spread it over the back of the chair and over the old man's shoulders. They were strange shoulders, still powerful although very old, and the neck was still strong too, and the creases did not show so much when the old man was asleep and his head fallen forward. His shirt had been patched so many times that it was like the sail, and the patches were faded to many different shades by the sun.
The [18] old man's head was very old though, and with his eyes closed, there was no life in his face. The newspaper lay across his knees, and the weight of his arm held it there in the evening breeze. He was barefooted.
The boy left him there, and when he came back, the old man was still asleep.
"Wake up, old man," the boy said and put his hand on one of the old man's knees.
The old man opened his eyes, and for a moment, he was coming back from a long way away. Then he smiled.
"What have you got?" he asked.
"Supper," said the boy. "We're going to have supper."

---

The Old Man and the Sea Asiaing.com
"I am not very hungry."
"Come hither and partake. Thou canst not fish and not eat."
"I have," the old man did say, rising and taking the newspaper, folding it with care. Then, he began to fold the blanket.
"Keep the blanket around thee," the boy did say. "Thou shalt not fish without eating whilst I am alive."
"Then live a long time and take care of thyself," the old man replied. "What fare doth await us?"
"Black beans and rice, fried bananas, and some stew."
The boy had brought them in a two-decker metal container from the Terrace. The two sets of knives and forks and spoons were in his pocket, each set wrapped in a paper napkin.
"Who hath bestowed this upon thee?"
"Martin. The owner."
"I must thank him."
"I have already thanked him," the boy did say. "Thou needest not thank him."
"I shall give him the belly meat of a great fish," the old man declared. "Hath he done this for us more than once?"
"I believe so."
"Then I must give him something more than the belly meat. He is most considerate towards us."
"He hath sent two beers."
"I do prefer the beer in cans," the old man acknowledged.
"I know. But this is in bottles, Hatuey beer, and I shall return the bottles."
"That is most kind of thee," the old man said. "Shall we partake?"
"I have been entreating thee to do so," the boy gently reminded him. "I have not wished to open the container until thou wert ready."
"I am ready now," the old man declared. "I merely required time to cleanse myself."
Where didst thou cleanse thyself? the boy pondered. The village water supply is two streets down the road. I must procure water for him here, the boy thought, and soap and a fine towel. Why am I so thoughtless? I must acquire another shirt and a jacket for the winter, and some manner of shoes and another blanket.

"Thy stew is excellent," quoth the old man.
"Pray, tell me of the baseball," the boy did ask.
"In the American League, 'tis the Yankees, as I have said," the old man replied with joy.
"They hath lost today," the boy did inform.
"That matters not. The great DiMaggio is himself once more."
"They hath other men on their team."
"Indeed, they do. But he maketh the difference. In the other league, betwixt Brooklyn and Philadelphia, I must side with Brooklyn. Yet, I do think of Dick Sisler and those mighty drives in the old park."
"Never hath there been aught like them. He striketh the longest ball mine eyes hath ever beheld."
"Dost thou remember when he used to visit the Terrace?"
[21] "I did desire to take him fishing, but I was too timid to ask. Then I beseeched thee to ask him, and thou wert too timid." "I know. 'Twas a grievous error. He might have joined us. Then we would have that memory for all our days." "I would fain take the great DiMaggio fishing," the old man declared. "They say his father was a fisherman. Mayhap he was as poor as we are and would understand." "The great Sisler's father was never poor, and he, the father, did play in the Big Leagues when he was mine age." "When I was thy age, I was afore the mast on a square rigged ship that sailed to Africa, and I have beheld lions on the beaches at eventide."
"I know. Thou hast told me."
"Should we speak of Africa or of baseball?"
"Baseball, methinks," the boy did say. "Tell me of the great John J. McGraw." He did say Jota for J.
"He did visit the Terrace on occasion in the days of yore. But he was rough and ill-spoken, and difficult when he was imbibing. His mind was on horses as well as baseball. He did carry lists of [22] horses at all times in his pocket and did oft speak the names of horses upon the telephone."
"He was a great manager," the boy did say. "My father doth believe him to be the greatest."
"For he did come hither most frequently," the old man did say. "If Durocher had continued to come hither each year, thy father would deem him the greatest manager."
"Who is the greatest manager, truly, Luque or Mike Gonzalez?"
"I do deem them equal."
"And the finest fisherman art thou."

"Nay. I know others better."
"Que Va," the boy said. "There are many good fishermen and some great ones. But there is only thee."
"Thank thee. Thou makest me happy. I hope no fish will come along so great that he will prove us wrong."
"There is no such fish if thou art still strong as thou sayest."
"I may not be as strong as I think," the old man said. "But I know many tricks and I have resolution." "Thou ought to go to bed now so that thou wilt be fresh in the morn. I will take the things back to the Terrace."
[23] "Good night then. I will wake thee in the morn."
"Thou art my alarm clock," the boy said.
"Age is my alarm clock," the old man said. "Why do old men wake so early? Is it to have one longer day?"
"I know not," the boy said. "All I know is that young boys sleep late and hard."
"I can remember it," the old man said. "I'll waken thee in time."
"I do not like for him to waken me. It is as though I were inferior."
"I know."
"Sleep well old man."
The boy went out. They had eaten with no light on the table and the old man took off his trousers and went to bed in the dark. He rolled his trousers up to make a pillow, putting the newspaper inside them. He rolled himself in the blanket and slept on the other old newspapers that covered the springs of the bed.
He was asleep in a short time and he dreamed of Africa when he was a boy and the long golden beaches and the white beaches, so white they hurt thine eyes, and the high capes and the great brown mountains. He lived along that coast now every night and in his dreams he heard the surf roar and saw the native boats [24] come riding through it. He smelled the tar and oakum of the deck as he slept and he smelled the smell of Africa that the land breeze brought at morn.
Usually when he smelled the land breeze he woke up and dressed to go and wake the boy. But tonight the smell of the land breeze came very early and he knew it was too early in his dream and went on dreaming to see the white peaks of the Islands rising from the sea and then he dreamed of the different harbours and roadsteads of the Canary Islands.
He no longer dreamed of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach. They played like young cats in the dusk and he loved them as he loved the boy. He never dreamed about the boy. He simply woke, looked out the open door at the moon and unrolled his trousers and put them on. He urinated.

外面的小屋，然后上路去叫醒那个男孩。他因为早晨的寒冷而发抖。但他知道他会因为发抖而变暖，很快他就会划船了。
男孩住的房子的门没有锁，他打开门，赤脚悄悄走进去。男孩在第一个房间的一张小床上睡着了，老人可以清楚地看到他，因为月亮的余辉照进来。他轻轻地抓住男孩的一只脚，握住直到男孩醒来，转过身看着他。
老人点了点头，男孩从床边的椅子上拿起他的裤子，坐在床上穿上。
老人走出门，男孩跟在他后面。他困倦得很，老人把胳膊搭在他肩上说：“对不起。”
“Qua Va，”男孩说。“这是一个人必须做的。”
他们沿着路走到老人的小屋，整个路上，黑暗中，赤脚的男人们都在移动，扛着他们船的桅杆。
当他们到达老人的小屋时，男孩拿起篮子里的绳索卷和鱼叉和钩子，老人肩上扛着带着卷帆的桅杆。
“你想要咖啡吗？”男孩问。
“我们把装备放在船上，然后再去拿。”
他们在一个早晨为渔民服务的地方喝了罐装牛奶咖啡。
“你睡得怎么样，老人？”男孩问。他现在醒了，尽管离开睡眠还是很困难。
“很好，Manolin，”老人说。“我今天感到自信。”
“我也是，”男孩说。“现在我必须拿你的沙丁鱼和我的，还有你的新鱼饵。他自己带我们的装备。他从不想让别人帮忙搬东西。”
“我们不一样，”老人说。“你五岁的时候我让你搬东西。”
“我知道，”男孩说。“我马上回来。再喝杯咖啡。我们在这里有信用。”
他走了，赤脚踩在珊瑚石上，去存放鱼饵的冰库。
老人慢慢地喝着咖啡。这是他一整天的食物，他知道他应该喝。很长一段时间以来，吃东西已经让他感到厌倦，他从不带午餐。他在船头有一瓶水，那就是他一天所需的全部。

The boy was back now with the sardines and the two baits wrapped in a newspaper
and they went down the trail to the skiff, feeling the pebbled sand under their feet, and
lifted the skiff and slid her into the water.
[27] "Good luck old man."
"Good luck," the old man said. He fitted the rope lashings of the oars onto the thole
pins and, leaning forward against the thrust of the blades in the water, he began to row
out of the harbour in the dark. There were other boats from the other beaches going out
to sea and the old man heard the dip and push of their oars even though he could not see
them now the moon was below the hills.
Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. But most of the boats were silent except
for the dip of the oars. They spread apart after they were out of the mouth of the harbour
and each one headed for the part of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. The old man
knew he was going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out into the
clean early morning smell of the ocean. He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in
the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well
because there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish
congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep walls of the floor of
the ocean. Here there were concentrations of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes schools
of squid in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the
wandering fish fed on them.
In the dark the old man could

I wrought the deep wells for a week and did naught, he bethought. Today I shall work out
where the schools of bonito and albacore are and mayhap there shall be a big one with them.
Ere it was truly light, he had his baits out and was drifting with the current. One bait
was down forty fathoms. The second was at seventy-five and the third and fourth were
down in the blue
water at one hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms. Each bait
hung head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and sewed solid and
all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the point, was covered with fresh
sardines. Each sardine was hooked through both eyes so that they made a half-garland on
the projecting steel. There was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel which was
not sweet smelling and good tasting.
The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung on the two
deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big blue runner and a yellow
jack that had been used before; but they were in good condition still and had the
excellent sardines to give them scent and attractiveness. Each line, as thick around as a
big pencil, was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the bait
would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils which could be made
fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were necessary, a fish could take out over three
hundred fathoms of line.
Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the skiff and rowed
gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at their proper depths. It was quite
light and any moment now the sun would rise.
The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other boats, low on
the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across the current. Then the sun was
brighter and the glare came on the water and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back
at his eyes so that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it. He looked down
into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into the dark of the
water. He kept them straighter than anyone did, so that at each level in the darkness of the
stream there would be a bait waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that
swam there. Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty
fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred.
But, he bethought, I keep them with precision. Only I have no luck any more. But who
knows? Maybe today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather
be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready.
The sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much to look
into the east. There were only three boats in sight now and they showed very low and far
inshore.
All my life the early sun has hurt mine eyes, he bethought. Yet they are still good. In the
evening I can look straight into it without getting the blackness. It has more force in the
evening too. But in the morning it is painful.
Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling in the sky
ahead of him. He made a quick drop, slanting down on his back-swept wings, and then

circled again.
"He hath something," the old man did say aloud. "He doth not just gaze."
He rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling. He did not haste
and he kept his lines straight up and down. But he crowded the current a little so that he
was still fishing correctly though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to
use the bird.
The bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings motionless. Then he dove
suddenly and the old man saw flying fish spurt out of the water and sail desperately over
the surface.
"Dolphin," the old man said aloud. "Big dolphin."
He shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow. It had a wire
leader and a medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of the sardines. He let it go
over the side and then made it fast to a ring bolt in the stern. Then he baited another line
and left it coiled in the shade of the bow. He went back to rowing and to watching the
long-winged black bird who was working, now, low over the water.
As he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and then
swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying fish. The old man could
see the slight bulge in the water that the big dolphin raised as they followed the escaping
fish. The dolphin were cutting through the water below the flight of the fish and would be
in the water, driving at speed, when the fish dropped. It is a big school of dolphin, he
thought. They are widespread and the flying fish have little chance. The bird hath no
chance. The flying fish are too big for him and they go too fast.
He watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the ineffectual movements
of the bird. That school hath gotten away from me, he thought. They are moving out too
fast and too far. But perhaps I will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish is around
them. My big fish must be somewhere.
The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only a long
green line with the gray blue hills behind it. The water was a dark blue now, so dark that
it was almost purple. As he looked down into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in
the dark water and the strange light the sun made now. He watched his lines to see them
go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so much plankton
because it meant fish. The strange light the sun made in the water, now that the sun was
higher, meant good weather and so did the shape of the clouds over the land. But the bird
was almost out of sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some
patches of yellow, sun-bleached Sargasso weed and the purple, formalized, iridescent,
gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man-of-war floating dose beside the boat. It turned on
its side and then righted itself. It floated cheerfully as a bubble with its long deadly purple
filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water.
"Agua mala," the man said. "Thou whore."
From where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the water and saw.

那些像拖尾丝一样有颜色的小鱼
在它们之间游动，在小阴影下
漂流的泡泡所形成的。它们对它的毒素免疫。
但人类不免疫，当一些丝状物附着在钓线上
而老人正在钓鱼时，他的手臂和手上会出现
像毒葛或毒橡树引起的那种疙瘩和疮。但是
这些来自agua mala的中毒会迅速发作，像鞭子一样打击。

那些彩虹般的泡泡很美。但它们是海洋中最虚假的东西
老人喜欢看到大海龟吃它们。海龟看到它们，
从前面接近它们，然后闭上眼睛，完全躲在壳里
吃掉它们的丝状物。老人喜欢看到海龟吃它们，他
也喜欢在暴风雨后在海滩上走，听到他踩在上面时它们发出的爆裂声
用他坚硬的脚底。

他喜欢绿海龟和鹰嘴龟，它们优雅而迅速，价值巨大
他对巨大而愚蠢的座头鲸心怀蔑视，它们的装甲是黄色的，它们的
交配方式奇特，它们很高兴吃掉葡萄牙水母，闭上眼睛。

他对海龟没有神秘感，尽管他已经在海龟船上工作了很多年。他为它们感到难过，即使是那些像小船一样长，重达一吨的大背壳龟。大多数人对海龟都没有感情，因为海龟的心脏在被切割和屠宰后还会跳动数小时。但老人想，我也有这样的心脏，我的脚和手就像它们一样。他吃白色的蛋来增加力量。他在五月份一直吃到九月和十月，为了迎接真正的大鱼。

他每天还喝一杯鲨鱼肝油，从渔船上的大桶里倒出来，那里有许多渔民放置他们的装备。所有想要的渔民都可以喝。大多数渔民都讨厌这种味道。但它并不比他们起床的时间更糟糕，而且对抗感冒和流感非常有效，对眼睛也有好处。

现在老人抬头看到鸟再次盘旋。

“它找到鱼了，”他大声说。没有飞鱼跃出水面，也没有鱼饵四散。但老人看着，一条小鲔鱼从水中升起，转身头朝下落入水中。鲔鱼在阳光下闪着银色的光芒，当它再次掉入水中时，又有一条鲔鱼升起，然后又有一条，它们在各个方向跳跃，搅动着水面，追逐着鱼饵。它们在盘旋，驱赶着鱼饵。

如果它们不跑得太快，我就会加入它们，老人想着，他看着鱼群在水中翻腾，而鸟儿则在鱼饵鱼被迫浮出水面时不断下降和探头。

“这只鸟真是个大帮助，”老人说。就在那时，船尾的绳子在他的脚下绷紧，他在那里留了一圈绳子，他放下桨，感受到小鲔鱼颤抖的拉力，他紧握住绳子，开始拉起来。随着他的拉力，颤抖加剧，他可以看到鱼在水中的蓝色背部和金色的侧面，然后他把鱼摆过船边，放进船里。他-13-

lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet shaped, his big, unintelligent eyes staring
as he thumped his life out against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering
strokes of his neat, fast-moving [38] tail. The old man hit him on the head for kindness
and kicked him, his body still shuddering, under the shade of the stern.
"Albacore," he said aloud. "He'll make a beautiful bait. He'll weigh ten pounds."
He did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he was by himself.
He had sung when he was by himself in the old days and he had sung at night sometimes
when he was alone steering on his watch in the smacks or in the turtle boats. He had
probably started to talk aloud, when alone, when the boy had left. But he did not
remember. When he and the boy fished together they usually spoke only when it was
necessary. They talked at night or when they were storm-bound by bad weather. It was
considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea and the old man had always
considered it so and respected it. But now he said his thoughts aloud many times since
there was no one that they could annoy.
"If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am crazy," he said
aloud. "But since I am not crazy, I do not care. And the rich have radios to talk to them in
their boats and to bring them the baseball."
[39] Now is no time to think of baseball, he thought. Now is the time to think of only
one thing. That which I was born for. There might be a big one around that school, he
thought. I picked up only a straggler from the albacore that were feeding. But they are
working far out and fast. Everything that shows on the surface today travels very fast and
to the north-east. Can that be the time of day? Or is it some sign of weather that I do not
know?
He could not see the green of the shore now but only the tops of the blue hills that
showed white as though they were snow-capped and the clouds that looked like high
snow mountains above them. The sea was very dark and the light made prisms in the
water. The myriad flecks of the plankton were annulled now by the high sun and it was
only the great deep prisms in the blue water that the old man saw now with his lines
going straight down into the water that was a mile deep.
The tuna, the fishermen called all the fish of that species tuna and only distinguished
among them by their proper names when they came to sell them or to trade them for
baits, were down again. The sun was [40] hot now and the old man felt it on the back of
his neck and felt the sweat trickle down his back as he rowed.
I could just drift, he thought, and sleep and put a bight of line around my toe to wake
me. But today is eighty-five days and I should fish the day well.
Just then, watching his lines, he saw one of the projecting green sticks dip sharply.
"Yes," he said. "Yes," and shipped his oars without bumping the boat. He reached out
for the line and held it softly between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. He felt
no strain nor weight and he held the line lightly. Then it came again. This time it was a
tentative pull, not solid nor heavy, and he knew exactly what it was. One hundred
fathoms down a marlin was eating the sardines that covered the point and the shank of

the hook where the hand-forged hook projected from the head of the small tuna.
The old man held the line delicately, and softly, with his left hand, unleashed it from
the stick. Now he could let it run through his fingers without the fish feeling any tension.
This far out, he must be huge in this month, he thought. Eat them, fish. Eat them.
Please eat them.
[41] How fresh they are and you down there six hundred feet in that cold water in the
dark. Make another turn in the dark and come back and eat them. He felt the light
delicate pulling and then a harder pull when a sardine’s head must have been more
difficult to break from the hook. Then there was nothing.
"Come on," the old man said aloud. "Make another turn. Just smell them. Aren't they
lovely? Eat them good now and then there is the tuna. Hard and cold and lovely. Don't be
shy, fish. Eat them."
He waited with the line between his thumb and his finger, watching it and the other
lines at the same time for the fish might have swum up or down. Then came the same
delicate pulling touch again.
"He'll take it," the old man said aloud. "God help him to take it."
He did not take it though. He was gone and the old man felt nothing.
"He can't have gone," he said. "Christ knows he can't have gone. He's making a turn.
Maybe he
has been hooked before and he remembers something of it.
[42] Then he felt the gentle touch on the line and he was happy.
"It was only his turn," he said. "He'll take it."
He was happy feeling the gentle pulling and then he felt something hard and
unbelievably heavy. It was the weight of the fish and he let the line slip down, down,
down, unrolling off the first of the two reserve coils. As it went down, slipping lightly
through the old man's fingers, he still could feel the great weight, though the pressure of
his thumb and finger were almost imperceptible. "What a fish," he said. "He has it
sideways in his mouth now and he is moving off with it."
Then he will turn and swallow it, he thought. He did not say that because he knew
that if you said a good thing it might not happen. He knew what a huge fish this was and
he thought of him moving away in the darkness with the tuna held crosswise in his
mouth. At that moment he felt him stop moving but the weight was still there. Then the
weight increased and he gave more line. He tightened the pressure of his thumb and
finger for a moment and the weight increased and was going straight down.
[43] "He's taken it," he said. "Now I'll let him eat it well."
He let the line slip through his fingers while he reached down with his left hand and
made fast the free end of the two reserve coils to the loop of the two reserve coils of the
next line. Now he was ready. He had three forty-fathom coils of line in reserve now, as

以及他使用的线圈。
“再吃一点，”他说。“好好吃。”
吃吧，让钩尖刺入你的心脏，杀死你，他想。
轻轻上来，让我把鱼叉插进你。好了。你准备好了吗？你在餐桌上待够时间了吗？
“现在！”他大声说道，双手用力一击，拉出一码线，然后再次击打，交替用力，用他的双臂和身体的重量摇摆。
什么都没发生。鱼慢慢游走，老人一寸也无法抬起它。他的线很结实，适合捕捉大鱼，他把它紧紧地拉在背后，直到它变得如此紧绷，水珠从上面跳跃出来。然后它开始在水中发出缓慢的嘶嘶声，他仍然抓住它，靠在船座上，倚靠着拉力。船开始缓慢地向西北方向移动。
鱼稳定地游动，他们在平静的水面上缓慢前行。其他的鱼饵还在水中，但是无能为力。
“我希望有个孩子。”老人大声说道。“我被一条鱼拖着，我是拖船的一部分。我可以把线固定住。但是他可能会折断它。我必须尽力抓住他，当他需要线时给他。感谢上帝，他在前进而不是下沉。”
如果他决定下沉，我该怎么办，我不知道。如果他下沉并死亡，我该怎么办，我不知道。但是我会做些什么。我还有很多事情可以做。
他把线压在背上，看着它在水中的倾斜和小船稳定地向西北方向移动。
这会杀死他，老人想。他不能永远这样做下去。但是四个小时后，鱼仍然稳定地游向大海，拖着小船，老人仍然坚定地抓住线。
“我在中午钩住他的，”他说。“我从未见过他。”
他在钩住鱼之前，把草帽紧紧压在头上，它划破了他的额头。他也口渴，他跪下来，小心不要用力拉线，尽可能地靠近船头，用一只手拿起水瓶。他打开瓶盖，喝了一点。然后他靠在船头上休息。他坐在未卸下的桅杆和帆上休息，努力不去思考，只是忍耐。
然后他回头看到后面没有陆地可见。这没关系，他想。我总是可以靠哈瓦那的光芒进来。太阳落山还有两个小时，也许他会在那之前上来。如果他不上来，也许他会在月亮升起时上来。如果他不这样做，也许他会在日出时上来。我没有抽筋，感觉很强壮。他嘴里才有钩子。

But what a fish to pull like that. He must have his mouth shut tight on the wire. I wish I
could see him. I wish I could see him only once to know what I have against me.
The fish never changed his course nor his direction [46] all that night as far as the
man could tell from watching the stars. It was cold after the sun went down and the old
man’s sweat dried cold on his back and his arms and his old legs. During the day he had
taken the sack that covered the bait box and spread it in the sun to dry. After the sun
went down he tied it around his neck so that it hung down over his back and he
cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his shoulders now. The sack
cushioned the line and he had found a way of leaning forward against the bow so that he
was almost comfortable. The position actually was only somewhat less intolerable; but he
thought of it as almost comfortable.
I can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me, he thought. Not as long as
he keeps this up.
Once he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at the stars and
checked his course. The line showed like a phosphorescent streak in the water straight
out from his shoulders. They were moving more slowly now and the glow of Havana was
not so strong, so that he knew the current must be carrying them to the eastward. If I lose
the glare of Havana we must be going more to the eastward, he thought. For if the fish’s
course held true I must see it for many more [47] hours. I wonder how the baseball came
out in the grand leagues today, he thought. It would be wonderful to do this with a radio.
Then he thought, think of it always. Think of what you are doing. You must do nothing
stupid.
Then he said aloud, “I wish I had the boy. To help me and to see this.”
No one should be

常讓雌魚先進食，而被鉤住的魚，即雌魚，展開了一場狂野、驚慌和絕望的搏鬥，很快就使她筋疲力盡，而雄魚一直陪伴在她身旁，在水面上與她交錯圈繞。他一直如此靠近，以至於老人擔心他會用他尾巴割斷魚線，尾巴鋒利如鐮刀，幾乎和那個大小和形狀相同。當老人用鉤子鉤住她並用棍子猛擊她時，他抓住了帶有砂紙邊緣的劍形嘴，用它在她頭頂上劃過，直到她的顏色變成幾乎像鏡子背面的顏色，然後在男孩的幫助下，把她吊上船，雄魚一直留在船邊。然後，當老人清理魚線並準備魚叉時，雄魚跳到船旁的空中，看看雌魚在哪裡，然後下潛，他的薰衣草色翅膀，也就是他的胸鰭，張開，展示出他所有寬闊的薰衣草色條紋。他很美，老人記得，他一直留下來。那是我見過他們最悲傷的事情，老人想。男孩也很傷心，我們向她道歉並迅速屠宰了她。
“我希望男孩在這裡，”他大聲說，並靠在船頭圓形的木板上，感受著他肩上的魚線穩定地向他所選擇的目標移動。
當曾經，因為我的背叛，他不得不做出選擇時，老人想。
他的選擇是留在深深的黑暗水域，遠離所有的陷阱和詭計。我的選擇是去那裡找到他，超越所有人。超越世界上所有的人。現在我們已經聯合在一起，從中午開始就一直如此。沒有人能幫助我們其中任何一個。
也許我不應該成為一個漁夫，他想。但那就是我生來的目的。我一定要記得在天亮後吃金槍魚。
在天亮之前的某個時候，有東西咬住了他身後的餌。他聽到木棍斷裂的聲音，魚線開始從船舷上急速滑出。在黑暗中，他鬆開了他的鞘刀，將所有的魚的張力都放在他的左肩上，他向後靠，將魚線割斷在船舷的木頭上。然後他割斷了最靠近他的另一條魚線，在黑暗中將備用線的末端固定住。他用一只手熟練地工作，用腳踩住線圈，將結縛緊。現在他有六個備用線圈。每個餌都有兩條，他割斷了兩條，魚咬住的餌也有兩條，它們都連接在一起。
等到天亮，他想，我會回到四十噚的餌那裡，也把它割斷，然後連接備用線圈。我將失去兩百噚的好加泰羅尼亞卡德爾和鉤子和領導者。那可以取代。但如果我鉤住一條魚，它把他割斷了，誰能取代這條魚呢？
我不知道剛才咬住餌的那條魚是什麼。它可能是一條馬林魚，或者是一條寬嘴魚，或者是一條鯊魚。我從未感受到它。我必須太快地擺脫它。
他大聲說：“我希望我有男孩。”

[51] But thou hast not the boy, he pondered. Thou hast only thyself and thou hadst
better work back to the last line now, in the dark or not in the dark, and cut it away and
hook up the two reserve coils.

So he did it. It was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a surge that pulled
him down on his face and made a cut below his eye. The blood ran down his cheek a little
way. But it coagulated and dried before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to
the bow and rested against the wood. He adjusted the sack and carefully worked the line
so that it came across a new part of his shoulders and, holding it anchored with his
shoulders, he carefully felt the pull of the fish and then felt with his hand the progress of
the skiff through the water.

I wonder what he made that lurch for, he pondered. The wire must have slipped on the
great hill of his back. Certainly his back cannot feel as badly as mine does. But he cannot
pull this skiff forever, no matter how great he is. Now everything is cleared away that
might make trouble and I have a big reserve of line; all that a man can ask.

“Fish,” he said softly, aloud, “I’ll stay with thee until I am dead.”

[52] He’ll stay with me too, I suppose, the old man pondered and he waited for it to be
light. It was cold now in the time before daylight and he pushed against the wood to be
warm. I can do it as long as he can, he pondered. And in the first light the line extended out
and down into the water. The boat moved steadily and when the first edge of the sun rose
it was on the old man’s right shoulder.

“He’s headed north,” the old man said. The current will have set us far to the
eastward, he pondered. I wish he would turn with the current. That would show that he
was tiring.

When the sun had risen further the old man realized that the fish was not tiring.
There was only one favorable sign. The slant of the line showed he was swimming at a
lesser depth. That did not necessarily mean that he would jump. But he might.

“God let him jump,” the old man said. “I have enough line to handle him.”

Maybe if I can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and he will jump, he
pondered. Now that it is daylight let him jump so that he’ll fill the sacks along his backbone
with air and then he cannot go deep to die.

[53] He tried to increase the tension, but the line had been taut up to the very edge of
the breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he felt the harshness as he leaned
back to pull and knew he could put no more strain on it. I must not jerk it ever, he
pondered. Each jerk widens the cut the hook makes and then when he does jump he might
throw it. Anyway I feel better with the sun and for once I do not have to look into it.

There was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made an added
drag and he was pleased. It was the yellow Gulf weed that had made so much
phosphorescence in the night.

“Fish,” he said, “I love thee and respect thee very much. But I will kill thee dead before
this day ends.”

Let us hope so, he thought.
A small bird came toward the skiff from the north. He was a warbler and flying very
low over
the water. The old man could see that he was very tired. The bird made the stern of
the boat and rested there. Then he flew around the old man’s head and rested on the line
where he was more comfortable. “How old are you?” the old man asked the bird. “Is this
your first trip?”
[54] The bird looked at him when he spoke. He was too tired even to examine the
line and he teetered on it as his delicate feet gripped it fast.
“It’s steady,” the old man told him. “It’s too steady. You shouldn’t be that tired after
a windless night. What are birds coming to?”
The hawks, he thought, that come out to sea to meet them. But he said nothing of
this to the bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the
hawks soon enough.
“Take a good rest, small bird,” he said. “Then go in and take your chance like any
man or bird or fish.”
It encouraged him to talk because his back had stiffened in the night and it hurt truly
now.
“Stay at my house if you like, bird,” he said. “I am sorry I cannot hoist the sail and
take you in with the small breeze that is rising. But I am with a friend.”
Just then the fish gave a sudden lurch that pulled the old man down onto the bow
and would have pulled him overboard if he had not braced himself and given some line.
The bird had flown up when the line jerked and the old man had not even seen him
go. He felt the line [55] carefully with his right hand and noticed his hand was bleeding.
“Something hurt him then,” he said aloud and pulled back on the line to see if he
could turn the fish. But when he was touching the breaking point he held steady and
settled back against the strain of the line.
“You’re feeling it now, fish,” he said. “And so, God knows, am I.”
He looked around for the bird now because he would have liked him for company.
The bird was gone.
Thou didst not stay long, the man thought. But it is rougher where thou art going until
thou makest the shore. How did I let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he made? I
must be getting very stupid. Or perhaps I was looking at the small bird and thinking of
him. Now I will pay attention to my work and then I must eat the tuna so that I will not
have a failure of strength.
“I wish the boy were here and that I had some salt,” he said aloud.

Shifting the weight of the line to his left shoulder and kneeling carefully he washed
his hand in the ocean and held it there, submerged, for more than a [56] minute watching
the blood trail away and the steady movement of the water against his hand as the boat
moved.
"He has slowed much," he said.
The old man would have liked to keep his hand in the salt water longer but he was
afraid of another sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up and braced himself and held
his hand up against the sun. It was only a line burn that had cut his flesh. But it was in
the working part of his hand. He knew he would need his hands before this was over and
he did not like to be cut before it started.
"Now," he said, when his hand had dried, "I must eat the small tuna. I can reach him
with the gaff and eat him here in comfort."
He knelt down and found the tuna under the stem with the gaff and drew it toward
him keeping it clear of the coiled lines. Holding the line with his left shoulder again, and
bracing on his left hand and arm, he took the tuna off the gaff hook and put the gaff back
in place. He put one knee on the fish and cut strips of dark red meat longitudinally from
the back of the head to the tail. They were wedge-shaped strips and he cut [57] them from
next to the back bone down to the edge of the belly. When he had cut six strips he spread
them out on the wood of the bow, wiped his knife on his trousers, and lifted the carcass of
the bonito by the tail and dropped it overboard.
"I don't think I can eat an entire one," he said and drew his knife across one of the
strips. He could feel the steady hard pull of the line and his left hand was cramped. It
drew up tight on the heavy cord and he looked at it in disgust.
"What kind of a hand is that," he said. "Cramp then if you want. Make yourself into a
claw. It will do you no good."
Come on, he thought and looked down into the dark water at the slant of the line.
Eat it now and it will strengthen the hand. It is not the hand's fault and you have been
many hours with the fish. But you can stay with him forever. Eat the bonito now.
He picked up a piece and put it in his mouth and chewed it slowly. It was not
unpleasant.
Chew it well, he thought, and get all the juices. It would not be had to eat with a little
lime or with lemon or with salt.
"How do you feel, hand?" he asked the cramped [58] hand that was almost as stiff as
rigor mortis. "I'll eat some more for you."
He ate the other part of the piece that he had cut in two. He chewed it carefully and
then spat out the skin.
"How does it go, hand? Or is it too early to know?"
He took another full piece and chewed it.

"Verily, a strong and full-blooded fish," he pondered. "Fortunate was I to capture him instead of a dolphin. Dolphin is too sweet. This creature, however, lacks sweetness and retains all its strength."

Yet, practicality must prevail, he thought. Would that I had some salt. And I know not if the sun shall spoil or dry what remains, so I shall consume it all, though hunger eludes me. The fish is calm and steady. I shall devour it in its entirety and then be prepared.

"Be patient, hand," he spoke. "I do this for thee."

Would that I could feed the fish, he pondered. He is my brother. But I must slay him and remain strong to accomplish it. Slowly and conscientiously, he consumed all the wedge-shaped strips of fish.

He stood upright, wiping his hand upon his trousers. "Now," he declared. "Release the cord, hand, and I shall handle him with my right arm alone until thou ceasest thy foolishness." He placed his left foot upon the heavy line that his left hand had held and reclined against the pull upon his back.

"God aid me in banishing this cramp," he beseeched. "For I know not what the fish shall do."

Yet, he appears calm, he thought, and follows his own plan. But what is his plan, he wondered. And what is mine? Mine must be improvised to match his, due to his immense size. If he should leap, I can slay him. But he remains submerged indefinitely. Then I shall remain submerged with him for eternity.

He rubbed his cramped hand against his trousers and attempted to soothe his fingers. Yet, it refused to open. Mayhaps it shall open with the sun, he thought. Mayhaps it shall open once the robust raw tuna is digested. If I must force it open, I shall, regardless of the cost. But I do not wish to force it open now. Let it open of its own accord and return to me willingly. After all, I mistreated it greatly during the night when it was necessary to free and untie the various lines.

He gazed across the sea and comprehended his profound solitude. Yet, he could perceive the prisms in the deep, dark water and the line stretching forth, as well as the peculiar undulation of the calm. The clouds were amassing now, heralding the trade wind, and he peered ahead, witnessing a flock of wild ducks etching themselves against the sky over the water, then blurring, then etching once more. He knew that no man was ever truly alone upon the sea.

He contemplated how some men feared being out of sight of land in a small boat, and he acknowledged their wisdom during the months of sudden inclement weather. But now, they were in the hurricane months, and when hurricanes were absent, the weather during these months was the finest of the year.

Should a hurricane approach, one can always discern the signs in the sky days in advance, if one is at sea. Those on land do not perceive it, for they know not what to look for, he thought. The land must also influence the shape of the clouds. But we have no hurricane approaching now.

He gazed at the sky and beheld the white cumulus clouds resembling friendly mounds of ice cream.

而高高在上，是九月高天中的薄薄的卷云。
“轻微的微风，”他说。“对我来说比对你这条鱼更好的天气。”
他的左手还是抽筋，但他慢慢地解开了它。
我讨厌抽筋，他想。这是身体的背叛。当别人因为食物中毒而拉肚子或呕吐时，这是一种羞辱。但是抽筋，他把它看作是一种calambre，尤其是当一个人独自一人时，这是一种自我羞辱。
如果小男孩在这里，他可以帮我揉一揉，松开前臂上的抽筋，他想。但它会松开的。
然后，他用右手感受到了线的拉力变化，然后才看到水面的倾斜变化。然后，当他倚在线上，用左手猛烈地拍打大腿时，他看到线慢慢地向上倾斜。
“它上来了，”他说。“来吧，手。请快点。”
线缓缓而稳定地上升，然后海洋的表面凸起，鱼跳出水面。它无休止地跳出来，水从它的身体两侧流出。它在阳光下闪闪发亮，头和背部呈深紫色，在阳光下，它身体两侧的条纹显示得很宽，呈浅紫色。它的剑就像一根棒球棒一样长，像一把细剑一样锋利，它从水中完全伸展出来，然后平稳地重新进入水中，就像一个潜水员，老人看到它的大镰刀般的尾巴下沉，线开始飞快地脱出。
“它比小船长两英尺，”老人说。线飞快地脱出，但鱼并没有惊慌。老人用双手试图保持线在断裂强度的范围内。他知道，如果他不能用稳定的压力减缓鱼的速度，鱼可能会拉出所有的线并将其断裂。
它是一条伟大的鱼，我必须说服它，他想。我绝不能让它知道自己的力量，也不能让它知道如果它发起冲刺会发生什么。如果我是它，我现在会全力以赴，直到有什么东西断裂。但是，感谢上帝，它们不像我们这些杀害它们的人那样聪明；尽管它们更高贵，更有能力。
老人曾见过许多大鱼。他见过许多重达一千磅以上的鱼，他一生中曾捕到过两条这样大小的鱼，但从未独自一人。现在，独自一人，远离陆地，他被绑在他见过的最大的鱼身上，比他听说的还要大，他的左手仍然像鹰的爪子一样紧紧地抓住。
它会松开的，他想。肯定会松开，以帮助我的右手。有三样东西是兄弟：鱼和我的两只手。它必须松开。它不值得抽筋。鱼又慢下来了，以它通常的速度前进。
我想知道它为什么跳，老人想。它跳得几乎像是要向我展示它有多大。不管怎样，我现在知道了，他想。但愿我能向他展示我是什么样的人。但是他会看到我的抽筋手。让他认为我是个更有男子气概的人。

比我更加亢奋，我将如此。他想，我希望我是那条鱼，他拥有一切
只是违背我的意愿和智慧。

他舒适地靠在木头上，接受他的痛苦，鱼稳定地游动，小船缓慢地穿过黑暗的水域。东风吹起，海面微微波动，中午时分，老人的左手不再抽筋。

“对你来说是个坏消息，鱼，”他说着，将鱼线移到覆盖肩膀的袋子上。

他感到舒适，但也在受苦，尽管他根本不承认自己在受苦。

“我不信教，”他说，“但我会说十个‘我们的天父’和十个‘圣母颂’，如果我能捕到这条鱼，我发誓要去朝圣到科布雷的圣母。这是一个承诺。”

他开始机械地念起祷告。有时候他会累得记不住祷告，然后他会快速地念，让它们自动出口。他觉得念‘圣母颂’比念‘我们的天父’容易。

“圣母玛利亚，充满恩宠，主与你同在。你在众女子中蒙福，你腹中所生的果子也蒙福，耶稣。圣母玛利亚，天主之母，请你为我们这些罪人祈求，现在和我们临终时。阿门。”然后他补充道：“圣母蒙福，请为这条鱼的死祈祷。尽管他是多么美妙。”

祷告完毕，他感觉好多了，但痛苦仍然如此，甚至可能更多，他靠在船头的木头上，机械地开始活动左手的手指。

太阳现在很热，尽管微风轻轻吹起。

“我最好重新装饵那根小线，放在船尾，”他说，“如果这条鱼决定再待一夜，我需要再吃一顿，瓶子里的水已经不多了。我想我在这里只能钓到一条海豚。但如果我足够新鲜地吃掉它，它就不会变坏。我希望今晚有一条飞鱼上船。但我没有灯光来吸引它们。飞鱼生吃非常美味，我不需要切割它们。现在我必须节省所有的力量。天啊，我不知道它这么大。”

“我会杀死它的，”他说，“在它的伟大和荣耀中。”

尽管这是不公正的，他想。但我会向他展示一个人能做什么，一个人能忍受什么。

“我告诉那个孩子我是个奇怪的老人，”他说。

“现在是我必须证明的时候。”

他已经证明了一千次，但那些都不重要。现在他再次证明。每一次都是新的一次，他在做的时候从不想过去。

The Old Man and the Sea Asiaing.com
I wish he’d sleep and I could sleep and dream about the lions, he thought. Why are
the lions the main thing that is left? Don’t think, old man, he said to himself, Rest gently
now against the wood and think of nothing. He is working. Work as little as you can.
It was getting into the afternoon and the boat still moved slowly and steadily. But
there was an added drag now from the easterly breeze and the old man [66] rode gently
with the small sea and the hurt of the cord across his back came to him easily and
smoothly.
Once in the afternoon the line started to rise again. But the fish only continued to
swim at a slightly higher level. The sun was on the old man’s left arm and shoulder and
on his back. So he knew the fish had turned east of north.
Now that he had seen him once, he could picture the fish swimming in the water
with his purple pectoral fins set wide as wings and the great erect tail slicing through the
dark. I wonder how much he sees at that depth, the old man thought. His eye is huge and
a horse, with much less eye, can see in the dark. Once I could see quite well in the dark.
Not in the absolute dark. But almost as a cat sees.
The sun and his steady movement of his fingers had uncramped his left hand now
completely and he began to shift more of the strain to it and he shrugged the muscles of
his back to shift the hurt of the cord a little.
"If thou art not weary, fish," he said aloud, "thou must be very strange."
He felt very weary now and he knew the night would come soon and he tried to think
of other things. He thought of the Big Leagues, to him they were the Gran [67] Ligas, and
he knew that the Yankees of New York were playing the Tigres of Detroit.
This is the second day now that I do not know the result of the juegos, he thought.
But I must have confidence and I must be worthy of the great DiMaggio who does all
things perfectly even with the pain of the bone spur in his heel. What is a bone spur? he
asked himself. Un espuela de hueso. We do not have them. Can it be as painful as the
spur of a fighting cock in one’s heel? I do not think I could endure that or the loss of the
eye and of both eyes and continue to fight as the fighting cocks do. Man is not much
beside the great birds and beasts. Still I would rather be that beast down there in the
darkness of the sea.
"Unless sharks come," he said aloud. "If sharks come, God pity him and me."
Dost thou believe the great DiMaggio would stay with a fish as long as I will stay with
this one? he thought. I am sure he would and more since he is young and strong. Also his
father was a fisherman. But would the bone spur hurt him too much?
"I do not know," he said aloud. "I never had a bone spur."
As the sun set he remembered, to give himself more [68] confidence, the time in the
tavern at Casablanca when he had played the hand game with the great negro from
Cienfuegos who was the strongest man on the docks. They had gone one day and one
night with their elbows on a chalk line on the table and their forearms straight up and
their hands gripped tight. Each one was trying to force the other’s hand down onto the

table. There was much betting and people went in and out of the room under the
kerosene lights and he had looked at the arm and hand of the negro and at the negro’s
face. They changed the referees every four hours after the first eight so that the referees
could sleep. Blood came out from under the fingernails of both his and the negro’s hands
and they looked each other in the eye and at their hands and forearms and the bettors
went in and out of the room and sat on high chairs against the wall and watched. The
walls were painted bright blue and were of wood and the lamps threw their shadows
against them. The negro’s shadow was huge and it moved on the wall as the breeze
moved the lamps.
The odds would change back and forth all night and they fed the negro rum and
lighted cigarettes for him.
Then the negro, after the rum, would try for a tremendous [69] effort and once he
had the old man, who was not an old man then but was Santiago El Campeon, nearly
three inches off balance. But the old man had raised his hand up to dead even again. He
was sure then that he had the negro, who was a fine man and a great athlete, beaten. And
at daylight when the bettors were asking that it be called a draw and the referee was
shaking his head, he had unleashed his effort and forced the hand of the negro down and
down until it rested on the wood. The match had started on a Sunday morning and ended
on a Monday morning. Many of the bettors had asked for a draw because they had to go
to work on the docks loading sacks of sugar or at the Havana Coal Company. Otherwise
everyone would have wanted it to go to a finish. But he had finished it anyway and before
anyone had to go to work.
For a long time after that everyone had called him The Champion and there had
been a return match in the spring. But not much money was bet and he had won it quite
easily since he had broken the confidence of the negro from Cienfuegos in the first match.
After that he had a few matches and then no more. He decided that he could beat anyone
if he wanted to badly enough and he decided that it was bad for his right [70] hand for
fishing. He had tried a few practice matches with his left hand. But his left hand had
always been a traitor and would not do what he called on it to do and he did not trust it.
The sun will bake it out well now, he thought. It should not cramp on me again
unless it gets too cold in the night. I wonder what this night will bring.
An airplane passed overhead on its course to Miami and he watched its shadow
scaring up the schools of flying fish.
“With so much flying fish there should be dolphin,” he said, and leaned back on the
line to see if it was possible to gain any on his fish. But he could not and it stayed at the
hardness and water-drop shivering that preceded breaking. The boat moved ahead slowly
and he watched the airplane until he could no longer see it.
It must be very strange in an airplane, he thought. I wonder what the sea looks like
from that height? They should be able to see the fish well if they do not fly too high. I
would like to fly very slowly at two hundred fathoms high and see the fish from above. In
the turtle boats I was in the cross-trees of the mast-head and even at that height I saw
much. The dolphin look greener from there and you can see their stripes and their purple.

[71] 看啊，魚群在水中遊動，你可以看到它們所有的身影。為什麼那些快速移動的魚在黑暗的洋流中都有紫色的背部，通常還有紫色的條紋或斑點呢？海豚當然是綠色的，因為它實際上是金色的。但是當它來進食時，真正飢餓的時候，紫色的條紋就會出現在它的側面，就像一條馬林魚一樣。是憤怒嗎，還是它更快的速度使它們顯現出來呢？

就在天黑之前，當他們經過一個巨大的海草島時，這個島在輕柔的海浪中搖擺，彷彿海洋正在與一個黃色的毯子下的某物做愛一般，他的小魚線被一條海豚奪走了。他第一次看到它是當它跳出水面時，它在夕陽的最後一縷光芒中呈現出真正的金色，並在空中狂舞彎曲。它一次又一次地跳躍，表演著害怕的雜技，而他則向船尾慢慢移動，蹲下，用右手和手臂握住大魚線，用左手將海豚拉進來，每次用赤裸的左腳踩住獲得的魚線。當魚在船尾處猛然下沉並左右擺動時，老人俯身過船尾，將那隻光亮的金色魚帶過船尾，上面有紫色的斑點。它的下顎在痙攣般地快速咬著鉤子，用它長而扁平的身體、尾巴和頭部猛烈地敲打著船底，直到他用棍子猛擊它閃亮的金色頭部，直到它顫抖不動。

老人解開魚鉤，用另一條沙丁魚重新裝餌，然後慢慢地回到船頭。他洗了洗左手，用褲子擦乾。然後他將沉重的魚線從右手換到左手，用右手在海水中洗淨，同時看著太陽沉入海洋和大繩索的傾斜。

他說：“它一點也沒有改變。”但是當他看著水流對著他的手的運動時，他注意到它明顯變慢了。

他說：“我會把兩槳綁在船尾，這樣它在夜晚就會減速。”他說：“它能撐過夜晚，我也能。”

最好稍後剖開海豚，以保存肉中的血液，他想。我可以稍後做這件事，同時用槳來拖曳。現在最好讓魚保持安靜，不要在日落時打擾它太多。對所有魚來說，太陽下山是一個困難的時刻。他讓手在空氣中乾燥，然後用它抓住魚線[73]，盡力讓自己向前拉，讓船承受更多的壓力，比他自己承受的還多。

他想：“我正在學習如何做到這一點。至少這一部分。”然後，也要記住，他自從咬餌以來就沒有進食，他很大，需要很多食物。我已經吃掉了整條鰹魚。明天我會吃掉這條海豚。他稱它為多拉多。也許我應該在清理它時吃一些。它比鰹魚更難吃。但是，沒有什麼是容易的。

他大聲問道：“你感覺如何，魚？”他說：“我感覺很好，我的左手好多了，我有一晚上和一天的食物。拉著船，魚。”

他並不真正感覺好，因為背上的繩子帶來的疼痛幾乎已經超越了疼痛，變成了一種他不信任的麻木感。但是我經歷過比這更糟糕的事情，他想。我的手只是輕微受傷，另一只手的抽筋已經消失了。- 27 -

吾之腿已康健，且吾已在食糧之問題上取得優勢。
九月之日，太陽西沉後，黑暗迅速降臨。老人躺在船頭磨損的木板上，盡其所能地休息。第一顆星星已經出現。他不知道瑞吉爾的名字，但他看到了它，並且知道很快所有的星星都會出現，他將擁有他遙遠的朋友們。
他大聲說：“這條魚也是我的朋友。我從未見過或聽說過這樣的魚。但我必須殺死它。我很高興我們不必試圖殺死星星。”
他想象每天一個人必須試圖殺死月亮。月亮會逃走。但想象一下，如果一個人每天都必須試圖殺死太陽呢？我們出生得幸運，他想。
然後，他為那條沒有食物的大魚感到遺憾，他對殺死它的決心在他對它的悲傷中從未放松。他想，他會餵飽多少人呢？但他們配得上吃他嗎？不，當然不配。從他的行為方式和他的偉大尊嚴來看，沒有人配得上吃他。
我不明白這些事情，他想。但我們不必試圖殺死太陽、月亮或星星，這是好事。在海上生活並殺死我們真正的兄弟已足夠。
現在，他想，我必須考慮拖網。它有其危險和優點。如果我失去太多的線，我可能會失去它，如果它努力掙脫，槳產生的拖力已經起作用，船失去了輕盈。船的輕盈延長了我們的痛苦，但對我來說是安全的，因為它有極高的速度，但從未使用過。無論發生什麼事，我必須剖開海豚，以免它變壞，吃一些來增強力量。
現在，我還要休息一個小時，確保它穩固可靠，然後再回到船尾做工作並做出決定。在此期間，我可以看到它的行為，看它是否有任何變化。槳是個好招數，但現在是時候玩安全了。它仍然是一條大魚，我看到鉤子在它嘴角，它一直緊閉嘴巴。鉤子的懲罰無關緊要。飢餓的懲罰，以及它對一些它無法理解的東西的抵抗，才是一切。休息吧，老人，讓它工作，直到下一個任務到來。
他休息了他認為是兩個小時。月亮現在直到很晚才升起，他無法判斷時間。他並沒有真正休息，除非相對而言。他仍然承受著魚的拉力，但他將左手放在船頭的舷邊上，越來越多地將對抗魚的阻力交給小船本身。
他想，如果我能將線固定住，那該多簡單啊。但只需一個小幅搖晃，它就會斷裂。我必須用身體緩衝線的拉力，隨時準備用雙手給線。
“但你還沒有睡覺，老人，”他大聲說。 “已經過了半天一夜，現在又是一天，你還沒有睡覺。你必須想辦法稍微休息一下，如果...”

他沉默而稳定。如果你不睡觉，你的头脑可能会变得不清晰。”
我头脑足够清晰，他想。太清晰了。我像星星一样清晰，它们是我的兄弟。但我必须睡觉。他们睡觉，月亮和太阳也睡觉，甚至海洋有时也在某些没有洋流和平静的日子里睡觉。
但要记得睡觉，他想。让自己去做，并想出一些简单而可靠的方法来处理这些线。现在回去准备海豚。如果你必须睡觉，把桨当作拖曳是太危险了。
我可以不睡觉，他告诉自己。但那太危险了。
[77] 他开始爬回船尾，小心翼翼地不要碰到鱼。他自己可能已经半睡半醒了，他想。但我不希望他休息。他必须一直拉到死。
回到船尾，他转过身来，左手承受着肩上的线的拉力，右手拔出刀子。星星现在很亮，他清楚地看到了海豚，他把刀子的刃插入它的头部，从船尾下面把它拖了出来。他把一只脚放在鱼上，迅速地从肛门切开到下颌尖。然后他放下刀子，用右手把它的内脏剖开，清理干净并拉出鳃。
他感到手中的胃很重，又滑又滑，他把它剖开。里面有两条飞鱼。它们新鲜而坚硬，他把它们并排放在一起，把内脏和鳃扔到船尾。它们下沉时在水中留下一条磷光的轨迹。海豚现在在星光下变得冷和白得像麻风病一样，老人一边用右脚踩住鱼的头部，一边剥掉了它的一侧皮。然后他把它翻过来，剥掉另一侧，从头到尾切下每一侧。
[78] 他把尸体扔到水里，看看水中是否有涡流。但只有它缓慢下沉的光亮。然后他转过身来，把两条飞鱼放在两片鱼肉中间，把刀子放回鞘里，慢慢地爬回船头。他的背因为肩上的线而弯曲，他用右手拿着鱼。
回到船头，他把两片鱼肉放在木板上，旁边是飞鱼。之后，他把线放在肩上的新位置，左手再次扶着舷边。然后他俯身在船边洗飞鱼，注意到水流对他手的速度。他的手因为剥鱼而发出磷光，他看着水流在手上流动。水流变得不那么强劲了，当他把手的一侧擦在船板上时，磷光的颗粒飘散出来，慢慢地向船尾漂去。
“它正在疲惫或休息，”老人说。“现在让我吃掉这条海豚，休息一下，睡一点。”
在星光下，夜晚变得越来越冷，他吃了半条海豚鱼肉和一条飞鱼，剖开并切掉头部。

"What a splendid fish dolphin is to eat when cooked," quoth he. "And what a wretched fish when raw. I shall never venture upon a boat again without salt or limes."
Had I possessed wit, I would have splashed water upon the bow all day, and by drying, it would have produced salt, he pondered. But alas, I did not hook the dolphin until the sun was nearly set. Still, it was a lack of preparation. Yet, I have chewed it thoroughly and am not nauseated.
The sky was becoming cloudy in the east, and one by one, the stars he knew disappeared. It appeared as though he was entering a vast canyon of clouds, and the wind had ceased.
"In three or four days, foul weather shall befall," he declared. "But not tonight, nor tomorrow. Prepare now to rest, old man, whilst the fish remains calm and steady."
He held the line tightly in his right hand, and pressed his thigh against his right hand, leaning his weight upon the wooden bow. Then, he passed the line lower upon his shoulders and braced his left hand upon it.
My right hand can hold it as long as it is supported, he thought. If it relaxes in slumber, my left hand shall awaken me as the line is drawn out. It is harsh upon the right hand. But it is accustomed to punishment. Even if I sleep for twenty minutes or half an hour, it is beneficial. He lay forward, contorting himself against the line with his entire body, placing all his weight upon his right hand, and he fell asleep.
He did not dream of the lions, but instead of a vast school of porpoises that stretched for eight or ten miles. It was the time of their mating, and they would leap high into the air and return to the same hole they had created in the water when they leapt.
Then, he dreamt that he was in the village, upon his bed, and there was a northerly wind, and he was exceedingly cold. His right arm was asleep, for his head had rested upon it instead of a pillow.
Afterwards, he began to dream of the long yellow beach, and he beheld the first of the lions descending upon it in the early darkness. Then, the other lions arrived, and he rested his chin upon the wooden bows where the ship lay anchored, with the evening offshore breeze, and he awaited to see if more lions would come, and he was content.
The moon had been aloft for a considerable time, yet he slumbered on, and the fish pulled steadily, and the boat ventured into the tunnel of clouds.
He awoke with a sudden jerk of his right fist colliding with his face, and the line burning through his right hand. He had no sensation in his left hand, but he strained with all his might using his right hand to slow the line's escape. Finally, his left hand found the line, and he leaned back against it, and now it scorched his back and his left hand, and his left hand bore the brunt and was grievously wounded. He glanced back at the coils of line, and they were smoothly unwinding. Just then, the fish leapt, causing a great commotion in the ocean, and then descended heavily. Then, it leapt again and again, and the boat sped swiftly, though the line continued to race out, and the old man strained it to the point of breaking, repeatedly. He had been pulled taut against the bow, and his face was pressed into the sliced dolphin, rendering him immobile.

此乃我所期待，思之良久。故让我们夺之。令其为线索付出代价，思之良久。令其为之付出代价。

鱼跃之状我未见，唯闻大海之声与其重击之声。线索之速度割伤吾手，然吾早已知晓此事将发生，故尽力使其割伤之处落于老茧之上，不让线索滑入掌心，亦不让其割伤指间。

若少年在此，必将湿润线索之卷绕，思之良久。是也。若少年在此。若少年在此。

线索不断延伸，不断延伸，不断延伸，然而此刻速度已减缓，鱼儿须为每一寸线索付出代价。此时，吾将头从木板上抬起，摆脱鱼肉碎片所压迫之处。随后，吾跪地，再缓缓起身。吾虽让线索逐渐脱离，但速度却愈来愈慢。吾退回至能以脚感受不见之线索之处。线索尚有充足，而鱼儿必须将所有新线索之摩擦力穿越水面。

是也，思之良久。如今，鱼儿已跃过十余次，背上之囊充满空气，无法深入水中以死，吾亦无法将其拖上来。他将很快开始盘旋，届时吾须与其周旋。不知何故，他突然如此行动？或许是饥饿使其绝望，思之良久，或许是夜晚之某物使其恐惧？或许他突然感到恐惧。然而他乃一条平静而强壮之鱼，似乎无所畏惧，自信满满。实在是奇怪。

“老人，你最好也要无所畏惧，充满自信，”他说道。“你再次控制住他，但无法获得线索。但他很快就会盘旋。”

老人用左手和肩膀牢牢控制住鱼儿，然后弯腰，用右手舀起水，将碎碎的海豚肉从脸上洗去。他担心这可能会使他恶心，导致呕吐，失去力量。当他的脸被清洗干净后，他将右手在船边的水中洗净，然后让其留在咸水中，同时观察日出前的第一缕光线。他正朝着东方前进，思之良久。这意味着他疲惫不堪，顺着洋流前行。很快，他将不得不盘旋。然后，我们真正的工作开始了。

在他判断右手在水中浸泡的时间足够长之后，他将其取出并看了看。

“还好，”他说。“对一个人来说，疼痛并不重要。”

他小心地握住线索，以免它进入任何新的线索切口，并转移重心，以便将左手放入船的另一侧的海水中。

“对于一无是处之物来说，你做得还不错，”他对自己的左手说道。“但有一刻我找不到你。”

为何我没有生来就有两只好手呢？他思之良久。或许是我没有适当地训练那只手的错。但上苍知道他有足够的机会去学习。虽然他在夜晚表现得不错，只抽筋了一次。如果他再次抽筋……

Let the line sever him.
When he deemed himself unclear and muddled,
He thought to chew on the dolphin once more.
But nay, he said to himself, I cannot.
Better to be light-headed than lose strength to sickness.
And I know I cannot keep it if I consume it,
For my face was immersed in it.
I shall keep it for dire need, until it spoils.
But 'tis too late to seek strength through nourishment.
Thou art foolish, he chided himself.
Consume the other flying fish.
There it lay, cleaned and prepared,
And he took it up with his left hand and ate,
Chewing the bones with care, consuming all,
Down to the very tail.
It possesses more nourishment than most fish, he thought.
At least, the kind of strength that I require.
Now I have done all I can, he thought.
Let him commence his circling, let the battle commence.
The sun had risen thrice since he set sail,
When the fish began its circling.
He could not see the fish circling by the angle of the line.
'Twas too early for such signs.
He merely sensed a slight slackening of the line's tension,
And gently pulled on it with his right hand.
It tightened, as always, but just as it neared breaking point,
The line began to come in.
He slipped his shoulders and head from beneath the line,
And steadily and gently pulled it in.
Using both hands in a swinging motion,
He tried to employ his body and legs in the pulling.
His aged legs and shoulders pivoted with each swing.
"'Tis a mighty circle," he said. "But he is circling."
Then the line ceased to come in,
And he held it until he saw droplets dancing in the sun.
Then it darted out, and the old man knelt down,
Reluctantly releasing it back into the dark water.
"He is now traversing the far part of his circle," he said.
I must hold on with all my might, he thought.
The strain shall shorten his circle with each turn.
Perhaps in an hour, I shall lay eyes upon him.
Now I must convince him, and then I must slay him.
But the fish continued its slow circling,
And the old man was drenched in sweat,
Weary to the core of his bones, two hours later.
Yet the circles were now much smaller,
And from the slant of the line, he could tell the fish had risen.
For an hour, the old man had been plagued by black spots,
And his sweat stung his eyes and the cut on his brow.
He feared not the black spots, for they were common
Under the strain he exerted on the line.
Twice, however, he felt faint and dizzy, and that troubled him.
I cannot fail myself and perish at the hands of this fish, he said.
Now that I have him approaching so splendidly,
May God grant me endurance. I shall recite a hundred Our Fathers,
And a hundred Hail Marys. But not now.
Consider them said, he thought. I shall say them later.
Just then, he felt a sudden jolt and jerk on the line he held with both hands.
It was sharp and forceful, and weighed heavily upon him.

He is hitting the wire leader with his spear, he [87] thought. That was bound to come.
He had to do that. It may make him jump though and I would rather he stayed circling
now. The jumps were necessary for him to take air. But after that each one can widen the
opening of the hook wound and he can throw the hook.
"Do not jump, fish," he said. "Do not jump."
The fish hit the wire several times more and each time he shook his head the old
man gave up a little line.
I must hold his pain where it is, he thought. Mine does not matter. I can control
mine. But his pain could drive him mad.
After a while the fish stopped beating at the wire and started circling slowly again.
The old man was gaining line steadily now. But he felt faint again. He lifted some sea
water with his left hand and put it on his head. Then he put more on and rubbed the back
of his neck.
"I have no cramps," he said. "He'll be up soon and I can last. You have to last. Do not
even speak of it."
He kneeled against the bow and, for a moment, slipped the line over his back again.
I'll rest now while he goes out on the circle and then stand up and work on him when he
comes in, he decided.
[88] It was a great temptation to rest in the bow and let the fish make one circle by
himself without recovering any line. But when the strain showed the fish had turned to
come toward the boat, the old man rose to his feet and started the pivoting and the
weaving pulling that brought in all the line he gained.
I am tireder than I have ever been, he thought, and now the trade wind is rising. But
that will be good to take him in with. I need that badly.
"I'll rest on the next turn as he goes out," he said. "I feel much better. Then in two or
three turns more I will have him."
His straw hat was far on the back of his head and he sank down into the bow with the
pull of the line as he felt the fish turn.
You work now, fish, he thought. I'll take you at the turn.
The sea had risen considerably. But it was a fair-weather breeze and he had to have it
to get home.
"I'll just steer south and west," he said. "A man is never lost at sea and it is a long
island."
It was on the third turn that he saw the fish first.
He saw him first as a dark shadow that took so long [89] to pass under the boat that
he could not believe its length.

"Nay," quoth he. "He cannot be so grand."
But he was indeed grand, and at the end of this circle, he emerged from the depths, a mere thirty yards away. The old man beheld his tail, raised above the water like a mighty scythe blade, a pale lavender hue against the dark blue sea. It swept back as the fish swam just beneath the surface, revealing its colossal size and the purple stripes that adorned its body. Its dorsal fin was lowered, and its massive pectorals were spread wide.
Upon this circle, the old man caught sight of the fish's eye, and the two gray sucking fish that swam around him. At times, they clung to his body, and at times, they darted away. Occasionally, they would glide effortlessly in his shadow. Each of them measured over three feet in length, and when they swam swiftly, their bodies writhed like eels.
The old man now perspired, not solely due to the scorching sun. With each calm revolution the fish made, he gained more line, and he was certain that in two more turns, he would have an opportunity to harpoon him.
[90] "But I must draw him near, near, near," he pondered. "I must not aim for his head. I must strike his heart."
"Be composed and resolute, old man," he uttered.
On the subsequent circle, the fish's back emerged, yet he remained slightly distant from the boat. On the following circle, he was still too far away, but he rose higher above the water, and the old man was confident that by reeling in some more line, he could bring him alongside.
He had prepared his harpoon long before, and its coil of light rope was contained within a round basket, its end securely fastened to the bow.
The fish now approached on his circle, serene and magnificent, with only his mighty tail in motion. The old man exerted all his strength to draw him closer. For a brief moment, the fish tilted slightly on his side, but then he straightened himself and commenced another revolution.
"I have moved him," the old man declared. "I moved him then."
Once again, he felt faint, yet he clung to the great fish with all the strain he could muster. I moved him, he thought. Perhaps this time, I can overcome him. Pull, hands, he thought. Stand firm, legs. Endure, head. Endure for me. You have never faltered. This time, I shall prevail and pull him over.
[91] However, when he exerted all his might, initiating the pull well before the fish came alongside, the fish resisted, only partially yielding before righting himself and swimming away.
"Fish," the old man lamented. "Fish, thou art destined to perish regardless. Must thou also slay me?"
Thus, naught is accomplished, he pondered. His mouth was too parched to speak, and he could not reach for water at this moment. I must bring him alongside this time, he thought. I am not capable of enduring many more revolutions. Yea, thou art, he assured himself. Thou art capable for eternity.

在下一次转弯时，他几乎抓住了鱼。但是鱼再次恢复了平衡，慢慢游走。

你正在杀死我，鱼，老人想。但你有权利这样做。我从未见过比你更伟大、更美丽、更平静、更高贵的东西，兄弟。

来吧，杀了我吧。我不在乎谁杀谁。

现在你的头脑混乱了，他想。你必须保持头脑清醒。保持头脑清醒，像个男人一样忍受痛苦。或者像一条鱼一样，他想。

“头脑清醒起来，”他用几乎听不见的声音说。“头脑清醒。”

[92] 在转弯时，又是两次相同的情况。我不知道，老人想。每次他都感觉自己快要倒下。我不知道。但我会再试一次。他再试了一次，当他转动鱼的时候，他感觉自己要倒下了。鱼恢复了平衡，又慢慢游走，巨大的尾巴在空中摇摆。我会再试一次，老人答应道，尽管他的手现在已经软绵绵的，只能间歇性地看清楚。他再试了一次，情况还是一样。所以他想，他在开始之前就感觉到自己要倒下了；我会再试一次。

他把所有的痛苦和剩下的力量以及他已经消失的自尊心都投入到了鱼的痛苦中，鱼翻身过来，温柔地侧着身子游动，嘴巴几乎碰到了船板，开始从船旁边悠长、深邃、宽阔、银色和紫色相间的水中经过，水中的景象无穷无尽。

老人放下了钓线，踩住它，尽可能高地举起鱼叉，全力将其刺入鱼的身体，他感觉到铁钩进入了鱼的身体，他倚在上面，继续往前推，然后用尽全力往下压。

然后，鱼活了过来，带着死亡的气息，高高地从水中升起，展示出他所有的长度、宽度、力量和美丽。他似乎悬浮在老人的头顶上方。然后他重重地掉进水中，溅起水花，洒在老人和整个小船上。

老人感到头晕和恶心，他看不清楚。但他清理了鱼叉线，让它慢慢从他生疼的手中滑过，当他能看见时，他看到鱼仰面朝上，银色的肚子朝上。鱼叉的杆子以一个角度从鱼的肩膀上伸出来，海水因为从鱼的心脏中流出的血而变得发红。起初，它像深不见底的蓝水中的一群鱼一样黑暗。然后它像一朵云一样扩散开来。鱼是银色的、静止的，随着波浪漂浮。

老人仔细地看了一眼他所能看到的景象。然后他在船头的绞盘上绕了两圈鱼叉线，把头藏在手中。

“保持头脑清醒，”他对船头的木头说。“我是一个疲惫的老人。但我已经杀了这条鱼，它是我的兄弟，现在我必须做奴隶的工作。”

现在我必须准备好绳索和绳子，把它绑在旁边，他想。即使我们是两个人，把船弄翻了，把它舀出来，这艘小船也永远不会……

持住他。我必须准备好一切，然后把他带进来，好好捆绑他，竖起桅杆，扬帆回家。
他开始把鱼拉近，让他靠近船边，这样他就可以通过鱼的鳃孔和嘴巴穿过一根绳子，把他的头固定在船头旁边。我想看看他，他想，想触摸和感受他。他是我的财富，他想。但这不是我想要触摸他的原因。我想我感受到了他的心脏，他想。当我第二次推动鱼叉杆时。现在把他带进来，把他固定好，把套索套在他的尾巴上，再套一条在他的中间，把他绑在船上。
“动起来，老人，”他说。他喝了一小口水。“现在战斗结束了，还有很多苦力活要做。”
他抬头看着天空，然后望向他的鱼。他仔细看着太阳。现在还不到正午，他想。而且东北风正在起来。现在这些钓线都无关紧要了。等我们回家后，我和那个小伙子会把它们拼接起来。
“来吧，鱼，”他说。但鱼没有过来。
相反，他在海中翻滚，老人把小船拉到他身边。
当他与鱼平齐，并把鱼的头靠在船头时，他简直不敢相信它的大小。但他把鱼叉绳从绞盘上解开，穿过鱼的鳃孔，从嘴巴里穿出来，绕过鱼的剑，然后再穿过另一侧的鳃孔，再绕过鱼的嘴巴，打结成双绳，把它系在船头的绞盘上。然后他剪断绳子，走到船尾套住鱼尾。鱼从最初的紫色和银色变成了银色，条纹显示出与尾巴相同的淡紫色。它们比一个人伸开手指的手掌还要宽，鱼的眼睛看起来像潜望镜中的镜子，或者像游行中的圣人。
“这是唯一杀死他的方法，”老人说。自从喝了水之后，他感觉好多了，他知道他不会离开，他的头脑清晰了。他现在至少有1500磅重，他想。也许更多。如果他剖开来的话，按照每磅30美分？
“我需要一支铅笔，”他说。“我的头脑还不够清晰。但我想伟大的迪马吉奥今天会为我感到骄傲。我没有骨刺。但手和背真的很痛。”我想知道骨刺是什么，他想。也许我们有它们，却不知道。
他把鱼系在船头、船尾和中间的座板上。他太大了，就像把一艘更大的小船系在旁边一样。他剪了一段绳子，把鱼的下颚绑在嘴巴上，这样他的嘴巴就不会张开，他们会尽可能地顺利航行。然后他竖起桅杆，用他的鱼叉杆和他的帆杆，修补过的帆拉起来，船开始移动，他半躺在船尾，向西南航行。
他不需要指南针告诉他西南的方向。他只需要感觉到-36-

of the trade wind and the drawing of the sail. I better put a small line [97] out with a
spoon on it and try and get something to eat and drink for the moisture. But he could not
find a spoon and his sardines were rotten. So he hooked a patch of yellow Gulf weed with
the gaff as they passed and shook it so that the small shrimps that were in it fell onto the
planking of the skiff. There were more than a dozen of them and they jumped and kicked
like sand fleas. The old man pinched their heads off with his thumb and forefinger and
ate them chewing up the shells and the tails. They were very tiny but he knew they were
nourishing and they tasted good.
The old man still had two drinks of water in the bottle and he used half of one after
he had eaten the shrimps. The skiff was sailing well considering the handicaps and he
steered with the tiller under his arm. He could see the fish and he had only to look at his
hands and feel his back against the stern to know that this had truly happened and was
not a dream. At one time when he was feeling so badly toward the end, he had thought
perhaps it was a dream. Then when he had seen the fish come out of the water and hang
motionless in the sky before he fell, he was sure there was some great strangeness and he
could not believe it.
[98] Then he could not see well, although now he saw as well as ever. Now he knew
there was the fish and his hands and back were no dream. The hands cure quickly, he
thought. I bled them clean and the salt water will heal them. The dark water of the true
gulf is the greatest healer that there is. All I must do is keep the head clear. The hands
have done their work and we sail well. With his mouth shut and his tail straight up and
down we sail like brothers. Then his head started to become a little unclear and he
thought, is he bringing me in or am I bringing him in? If I were towing him behind there
would be no question. Nor if the fish were in the skiff, with all dignity gone, there would
be no question either. But they were sailing together lashed side by side and the old man
thought, let him bring me in if it pleases him. I am only better than him through trickery
and he meant me no harm.
They sailed well and the old man soaked his hands in the salt water and tried to keep
his head clear. There were high cumulus clouds and enough cirrus above them so that the
old man knew the breeze would last all night. The old man looked at the fish constantly
[99] to make sure it was true. It was an hour before the first shark hit him.
The shark was not an accident. He had come up from deep down in the water as the
dark cloud of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile deep sea. He had come up so
fast and absolutely without caution that he broke the surface of the blue water and was in
the sun. Then he fell back into the sea and picked up the scent and started swimming on
the course the skiff and the fish had taken.
Sometimes he lost the scent. But he would pick it up again, or have just a trace of it,
and he swam fast and hard on the course. He was a very big Make shark built to swim as
fast as the fastest fish in the sea and everything about him was beautiful except his jaws.
His back was as blue as a sword fish’s and his belly was silver and his hide was smooth
and handsome. He was built as a sword fish except for his huge jaws which were tight
shut now as he swam fast, just under the surface with his high dorsal fin knifing through
the water without wavering. Inside the closed double lip of his jaws all of his eight rows of
teeth were slanted inwards. They were not the ordinary pyramid-shaped teeth of most
sharks, but flat and triangular and as sharp as the teeth of a saw.

鲨鱼。它们的形状就像人的手指一样，当它们像爪子一样变得脆硬时。
它们几乎和老人的手指一样长，两侧都有锋利的切割边缘。这是一种为了吃掉海中所有鱼类而建造的鱼，它们如此迅速、强壮和武装到牙齿，没有其他敌人。现在，当它闻到更新鲜的气味时，它加速前进，它的蓝色背鳍划破水面。
当老人看到它靠近时，他知道这是一条毫无畏惧的鲨鱼，会完全按照他的意愿行事。他准备好了鱼叉，同时观察着鲨鱼的接近。绳子很短，因为他割掉了一部分来捆绑鱼。
老人的头脑现在清晰而明晰，他充满了决心，但他几乎没有希望。他想，这太好了，不会持续下去。他看了一眼那条巨大的鱼，当他看着鲨鱼靠近时。他想，这可能就像是一个梦一样。我无法阻止它撞击我，但也许我可以击败它。Dentuso，他想。你妈妈真倒霉。
鲨鱼迅速靠近，当它撞击鱼时，老人看到它的嘴张开，它奇怪的眼睛和牙齿的咔哒声，当它向前推进时，刚好在尾巴上方的肉上。鲨鱼的头部露出水面，它的背部也露出水面，当老人将鱼叉猛力刺向鲨鱼的头部时，他能听到大鱼上的皮肤和肉撕裂的声音，鱼叉刺中了鲨鱼的头部，正好在它的眼睛之间的线与从它的鼻子直线向后延伸的线相交的地方。没有这样的线。只有沉重而锋利的蓝色头部、大眼睛和咔哒声、推进一切的大嘴。但那就是大脑的位置，老人击中了它。他用他血迹斑斑的手猛力驱动着一把好鱼叉。他没有希望，但有决心和完全的恶意。
鲨鱼翻了个身，老人看到它的眼睛已经死了，然后它再次翻了个身，用绳子的两个环绕住自己。老人知道它已经死了，但鲨鱼不接受这个事实。然后，它背朝上，尾巴拍打着水面，嘴巴咔哒作响，鲨鱼像快艇一样在水面上犁过。它的尾巴拍打的地方水变白了，当绳子绷紧、颤动，然后断裂时，它的身体有四分之三清晰地露出水面。鲨鱼在水面上静静地躺了一会儿，老人看着它。然后它很慢地下沉。
"它吃了大约四十磅，"老人大声说。它也拿走了我的鱼叉和所有的绳子，他想，现在我的鱼又流血了，还会有其他鲨鱼。自从它被毁容后，他不喜欢再看这条鱼。当鱼被击中时，就好像他自己被击中了一样。但是我杀死了那条撞击我的鲨鱼，他想。而且它是我见过的最大的dentuso。上帝知道我见过多大的鱼。这太好了，他想。我希望这只是一个梦，我从来没有钓到这条鱼，而是独自一人躺在床上看报纸。
"但人不是为了失败而生的，"他说。"一个人可以被摧毁，但不能被打败。"虽然我很遗憾杀了这条鱼，他想。现在糟糕的时光要来了，而我甚至没有鱼叉。dentuso是残忍、能干、强壮和聪明的。但我比他更聪明。也许不是，他想。也许我只是武装得更好。

"Think not, old man," he spake aloud. "Sail on this course and seize it when it comes.
But I must ponder, he pondered. For it is all I possess. That and baseball. I wonder
how the great DiMaggio would have liked the way I struck him in the brain? It was no
great feat, he pondered. Any man could achieve it. But dost thou think my hands were as great a
hindrance as the bone spurs? I cannot know. I never had aught amiss with my heel
save the time the sting ray stung it when I trod upon him whilst swimming and
paralyzed the lower leg and caused unbearable pain.
"Think on something merry, old man," he spake. "Every minute now thou art
nearer to home. Thou sail lighter for the loss of forty pounds."
He knew full well the pattern of what could befall when he reached the inner part
of the current. But there was naught to be done now.
"Yes, there is," he spake aloud. "I can fasten my knife to the end of one of the oars."
So he did that with the tiller beneath his arm and the sheet of the sail beneath his foot.
"Now," he spake. "I am still an old man. But I am not unarmed."
The breeze was fresh now and he sailed on well. He watched only the forward part of
the fish and some of his hope returned.
It is foolish not to hope, he pondered. Besides, I believe it is a sin. Think not
of sin, he pondered. There are enough troubles now without sin. Also, I have no
understanding of it.
I have no understanding of it and I am not sure that I believe in it. Perchance it was a
sin to slay the fish. I suppose it was even though I did it to keep me alive and feed many
people. But then everything is a sin. Think not of sin. It is much too late for that
and there are people who are paid to do it. Let them think on it. Thou wert born to be a
fisherman as the fish was born to be a fish. San Pedro was a fisherman as was the father
of the great DiMaggio.
But he liked to ponder on all things that he was involved in and since there was
naught to read and he did not possess a radio, he pondered much and he kept on pondering
about sin. Thou didst not slay the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food, he pondered. Thou
slew him for pride and because thou art a fisherman. Thou loved him when he was alive
and thou loved him after. If thou lovest him, it is not a sin to slay him. Or is it more?
"Thou ponderest too much, old man," he spake aloud.
But thou didst enjoy slaying the dentuso, he pondered. He lives on the live fish as thou dost.
He is not a scavenger nor merely a moving appetite as some sharks are. He is fair
and noble and knows no fear of aught.
"I slew him in self-defense," the old man spake aloud. "And I slew him well."
Besides, he pondered, everything slays everything else in some manner. Fishing slays me
exactly as it keeps me alive. The boy keeps me alive, he pondered. I must not deceive.

我自己太多了。
他俯身在船边，拉开了鲨鱼咬伤的鱼肉。他咀嚼着，品尝着它的质地和美味。它坚实多汁，像肉一样，但不是红色的。没有丝状物质，他知道它会在市场上卖得最高价。但是没有办法让它的气味不进入水中，老人知道困难的时刻即将来临。
微风稳定。它稍微向东北方向偏转，老人知道这意味着它不会减弱。老人向前看，但他看不到帆，也看不到船体或任何船只的烟雾。只有从船头飞起的飞鱼，向两侧飞去，还有墨西哥湾的黄色海藻斑块。他甚至看不到一只鸟。
[106] 他已经航行了两个小时，在船尾休息，有时咀嚼一点马林鱼的肉，试图休息和保持强壮，当他看到两条鲨鱼中的第一条时，他大声说道：“Ay。”这个词没有翻译，也许只是一个人无意识地发出的声音，感觉到钉子穿过他的手进入木头。
“Galanos，”他大声说。他现在看到第二只鳍从后面冒出来，通过棕色的三角鳍和尾巴的扫动动作，他确定它们是铲鼻鲨。它们闻到了气味，兴奋起来，在它们的饥饿愚蠢中，它们在兴奋中失去并找到气味。但它们一直在靠近。
老人把帆绳固定住，把舵杆卡住。然后他拿起绑在桨上的刀。他尽量轻轻地举起它，因为他的手对疼痛感到反抗。然后他轻轻地打开和闭合手指，以放松它们。他紧紧地闭合它们，让它们现在承受疼痛，不会退缩，看着鲨鱼靠近。他现在能看到它们宽阔、扁平、铲状的头部，以及它们白色尖端的胸鳍。它们是可恶的鲨鱼，[107] 气味难闻，既是食腐动物又是杀手，当它们饥饿时，它们会咬船桨或船舵。正是这些鲨鱼在海龟在水面上睡觉时割断了它们的腿和鳍，如果它们饥饿，它们会袭击水中的人，即使这个人身上没有鱼血或鱼黏液的气味。
“Ay，”老人说。“Galanos。来吧，Galanos。”
它们来了。但它们没有像马科鲨鱼那样来。一只鲨鱼转身消失在小船下面，老人能感觉到小船在他拉扯鱼时摇晃。另一只鲨鱼用它的黄色眯眼盯着老人，然后迅速靠近，张开半圆形的大嘴咬向已经被咬过的鱼的地方。线条清晰地显示在它棕色的头部和背部上，脑部与脊髓相连的地方，老人用刀将桨插入这个连接处，拔出来，再次插入鲨鱼的黄色猫眼。鲨鱼松开了鱼，滑下去，吞下它已经咬下的东西，然后死去。
小船仍然在震动，另一只鲨鱼正在对鱼进行破坏，老人放开了帆绳，让小船侧倾，带来了- 40 -

the shark out from under. When he saw the shark he leaned over the side and punched at
him. He hit only meat and the hide was set hard and he barely got the knife in. The blow
hurt not only his hands but his shoulder too. But the shark came up fast with his head out
and the old man hit him squarely in the center of his flat-topped head as his nose came
out of water and lay against the fish. The old man withdrew the blade and punched the
shark exactly in the same spot again. He still hung to the fish with his jaws hooked and
the old man stabbed him in his left eye. The shark still hung there.
"No?" the old man said and he drove the blade between the vertebrae and the brain.
It was an easy shot now and he felt the cartilage sever. The old man reversed the oar and
put the blade between the shark's jaws to open them. He twisted the blade and as the
shark slid loose he said, "Go on, galano. Slide down a mile deep. Go see your friend, or
maybe it's your mother."
The old man wiped the blade of his knife and laid down the oar. Then he found the
sheet and the sail filled and he brought the skiff onto her course.
[109] "They must have taken a quarter of him and of the best meat," he said aloud. "I
wish it were a dream and that I had never hooked him. I'm sorry about it, fish. It makes
everything wrong." He stopped and he did not want to look at the fish now. Drained of
blood and awash he looked the colour of the silver backing of a minor and his stripes still
showed.
"I shouldn't have gone out so far, fish," he said. "Neither for you nor for me. I'm
sorry, fish."
Now, he said to himself. Look to the lashing on the knife and see if it has been cut.
Then get your hand in order because there still is more to come.
"I wish I had a stone for the knife," the old man said after he had checked the lashing
on the oar butt. "I should have brought a stone." You should have brought many things,
he thought. But you did not bring them, old man. Now is no time to think of what you do
not have. Think of what you can do with what there is.
"You give me much good counsel," he said aloud. "I'm tired of it." He held the tiller
under his arm and soaked both his hands in the water as the skiff drove forward. "God
knows how much that last one took," he said.
[110] "But she's much lighter now." He did not want to think of the mutilated
under-side of the fish. He knew that each of the jerking bumps of the shark had been
meat torn away and that the fish now made a trail for all sharks as wide as a highway
through the sea.
He was a fish to keep a man all winter, he thought Don't think of that. Just rest and
try to get your hands in shape to defend what is left of him. The blood smell from my
hands means nothing now with all that scent in the water. Besides they do not bleed
much. There is nothing cut that means anything. The bleeding may keep the left from
cramping.
What can I think of now? he thought. Nothing. I must think of nothing and wait for

the next ones. I wish it had really been a dream, he thought. But who knows? It might
have turned out well.

The next shark that came was a single shovelnose. He came like a pig to the trough if
a pig had a mouth so wide that you could put your head in it. The old man let him hit the
fish and then drove the knife on the oar don into his brain. But the shark jerked
backwards as he rolled and the knife blade snapped.

The old man settled himself to steer. He did not even watch the big shark sinking
slowly in the water, showing first life-size, then small, then tiny. That always
fascinated the old man. But he did not even watch it now.

“I have the gaff now,” he said. “But it will do no good. I have the two oars and the
tiller and the short club.”

Now they have beaten me, he thought. I am too old to club sharks to death. But I will
try it as long as I have the oars and the short club and the tiller.

He put his hands in the water again to soak them. It was getting late in the afternoon
and he saw nothing but the sea and the sky. There was more wind in the sky than there
had been, and soon he hoped that he would see land.

“You’re tired, old man,” he said. “You’re tired inside.”

The sharks did not hit him again until just before sunset.

The old man saw the brown fins coming along the wide trail the fish must make in
the water.

They were not even quartering on the scent. They were headed straight for the skiff
swimming side by side. He jammed the tiller, made the sheet fast and reached under the
stem for the club. It was an oar handle from a broken oar sawed off to about two
and a half feet in length. He could only use it
effectively with one hand because of the grip of the handle and he took good hold of
it with his right hand, flexing his hand on it, as he watched the sharks come. They were
both galanos.

I must let the first one get a good hold and hit him on the point of the nose or
straight across the top of the head, he thought.

The two sharks closed together and as he saw the one nearest him open his jaws and
sink them into the silver side of the fish, he raised the club high and brought it down
heavy and slamming onto the top of the shark’s broad head. He felt the rubbery solidity
as the club came down. But he felt the rigidity of bone too and he struck the shark once
more hard across the point of the nose as he slid down from the fish.

The other shark had been in and out and now came in again with his jaws wide. The
old man could see pieces of the meat of the fish spilling white from the corner of his jaws
as he bumped the fish and closed his jaws. He swung at him and hit only the head and the
shark looked at him and wrenched the meat loose. The old man swung the club.

The Old Man and the Sea Asiaing.com
down on him again as he slipped away to swallow and hit only the heavy solid
rubberiness.
"Come on, galano," the old man said. "Come in again."
The shark came in a rush and the old man hit him as he shut his jaws. He hit him
solidly and from as high up as he could raise the club. This time he felt the bone at the
base of the brain and he hit him again in the same place while the shark tore the meat
loose sluggishly and slid down from the fish.
The old man watched for him to come again but neither shark showed. Then he saw
one on the surface swimming in circles. He did not see the fin of the other.
I could not expect to kill them, he thought. I could have in my time. But I have hurt
them both badly and neither one can feel very good. If I could have used a bat with two
hands I could have killed the first one surely. Even now, he thought.
He did not want to look at the fish. He knew that half of him had been destroyed.
The sun had gone down while he had been in the fight with the sharks.
"It will be dark soon," he said. "Then I should see the glow of Havana. If I am
too far to the eastward I will see the lights of one of the new beaches."
I cannot be too far out now, he thought. I hope no one has been too worried. There is
only the boy to worry, of course. But I am sure he would have confidence. Many of the
older fishermen will worry. Many others too, he thought. I live in a good town.
He could not talk to the fish anymore because the fish had been ruined too badly.
Then something came into his head.
"Half fish," he said. "Fish that you were. I am sorry that I went too far out. I ruined
us both. But we have killed many sharks, you and I, and ruined many others. How many
did you ever kill, old fish? You do not have that spear on your head for nothing."
He liked to think of the fish and what he could do to a shark if he were swimming
free. I should have chopped the bill off to fight them with, he thought. But there was no
hatchet and then there was no knife.
But if I had, and could have lashed it to an oar butt, what a weapon. Then we might
have fought them together. What will you do now if they come in the night? What can you
do?
"Fight them," he said. "I'll fight them until I die."
But in the dark now and no glow showing and no lights and only the wind and
the steady pull of the sail he felt that perhaps he was already dead. He put his two hands
together and felt the palms. They were not dead and he could bring the pain of life by
simply opening and closing them. He leaned his back against the stern and knew he was
not dead. His shoulders told him.
I have all those prayers I promised if I caught the fish, he thought. But I am too tired.

to say them now. I better get the sack and put it over my shoulders.
He lay in the stern and steered and watched for the glow to come in the sky. I have
half of him, he thought. Maybe I’ll have the luck to bring the forward half in. I should
have some luck. No, he said. You violated your luck when you went too far outside.
"Do not be foolish," he said aloud. "And stay awake and steer. You may still have much luck."
"I would like to buy some if there is any place that sells it," he said.
What could I buy it with? he asked himself. Could I buy it with a lost harpoon and a
broken knife and two bad hands?
"You might," he said. "You tried to buy it with eighty-four days at sea. They
nearly sold it to you too."
I must not think nonsense, he thought. Luck is a thing that comes in many forms and
who can recognize her? I would take some though in any form and pay what they asked. I
wish I could see the glow from the lights, he thought. I wish too many things. But that is
the thing I wish for now. He tried to settle more comfortably to steer and from his pain he
knew he was not dead.
He saw the reflected glare of the lights of the city at what must have been around ten
o'clock at night. They were only perceptible at first as the light is in the sky before the
moon rises. Then they were steady to see across the ocean which was rough now with the
increasing breeze. He steered inside of the glow and he thought that now, soon, he must
hit the edge of the stream.
Now it is over, he thought. They will probably hit me again. But what can a man do
against them in the dark without a weapon?
He was stiff and sore now and his wounds and all of the strained parts of his body
hurt with the cold of the night. I hope I do not have to fight again, he thought. I hope so
much I do not have to fight again.
But by midnight he fought and this time he knew the fight was useless. They
came in a pack and he could only see the lines in the water that their fins made and their
phosphorescence as they threw themselves on the fish. He clubbed at heads and heard
the jaws chop and the shaking of the skiff as they took hold below. He clubbed
desperately at what he could only feel and hear and he felt something seize the club and it
was gone.
He jerked the tiller free from the rudder and beat and chopped with it, holding it in
both hands and driving it down again and again. But they were up to the bow now and
driving in one after the other and together, tearing off the pieces of meat that showed
glowing below the sea as they turned to come once more.
One came, finally, against the head itself and he knew that it was over. He swung the
tiller across the shark’s head where the jaws were caught in the heaviness of the fish’s
head which would not tear. He swung it once and twice and again. He heard the tiller

断裂，他用断裂的尾部向鲨鱼扑去。他感觉到它进入了鲨鱼体内，知道它很锋利，他再次将其插入。鲨鱼松开了，滚开了。那是来的鲨鱼群中的最后一条鲨鱼。它们再也没有什么可吃的了。
老人现在几乎无法呼吸，嘴里有一种奇怪的味道。它带有铜质和甜味，他一时间感到害怕。但它并不多。
他向海洋吐了口唾沫，说：“吃吧，加拉诺斯。做个梦，你杀了一个人。”
他知道自己现在已经被打败了，无可挽回，他回到船尾，发现破碎的舵柄的锯齿状末端足以适应舵的槽口，让他能够操纵。他把袋子放在肩上，让小船按照他的意愿航行。他现在轻松地航行着，没有任何思想，也没有任何感觉。他已经超越了一切，他尽可能地智能地将小船航向他的家港。在夜晚，鲨鱼撞击着尸体，就像有人从桌子上拿起面包屑一样。老人没有注意它们，也没有注意任何事情，只注意操纵。他只注意到小船在没有重物的情况下轻盈而优雅地航行。
[119] 她很好，他想。她没有受到任何伤害，除了舵柄。那很容易更换。他能感觉到自己现在在洋流中，他能看到沿岸的海滩殖民地的灯光。他现在知道自己在哪里，回家并不困难。
风是我们的朋友，无论如何，他想。然后他补充说，有时候。还有我们的朋友和敌人的大海。还有床，他想。床是我的朋友。只有床，他想。床将是一件伟大的事情。当你被打败时，这很容易，他想。我从来不知道这是多么容易。以及是什么打败了你，他想。
“没有什么，”他大声说道。“我出去得太远了。”
当他驶入小港口时，露台上的灯光已经熄灭，他知道每个人都已经上床睡觉了。微风不断增强，现在正猛烈地吹着。然而，港口里很安静，他驶上了岩石下面的一小块鹅卵石。没有人来帮他，所以他尽可能地把船拉上来。然后他走出来，把船牢牢地绑在一块岩石上。
[120] 他卸下桅杆，收起帆，把它绑好。然后他扛起桅杆开始爬。那时他才知道自己有多么疲倦。他停了一会儿，回头看着，从街灯的反射中看到鱼的尾巴高高地竖立在小船的船尾后面。他看到了他的脊椎骨的白色裸线，以及带有突出的喙和所有裸露部分的黑色块状物。
他又开始爬，到了山顶，他摔倒了，躺了一段时间，桅杆横在肩上。他试图站起来。但这太困难了，他坐在那里，桅杆压在肩上，看着路。一只猫从远处经过，忙着自己的事情，老人看着它。然后他只是看着路。

At last, he lowered the mast and rose to his feet. He lifted the mast and placed it upon his shoulder, and began his journey up the road. Five times he had to rest before reaching his humble abode.

Inside the shack, he leaned the mast against the wall. In the darkness, he found a water bottle and took a sip. Then, he lay down upon the bed. He covered himself with a blanket, first over his shoulders, then over his back and legs. He slept face down upon the newspapers, his arms outstretched and his palms facing upwards.

In the morning, as the boy peered through the door, he found the old man fast asleep. The wind blew fiercely, preventing the boats from venturing out to sea. The boy had overslept and arrived at the old man's shack later than usual. When he saw that the old man was breathing, he noticed his hands and began to weep. Quietly, he left to fetch some coffee, crying all the way down the road.

Many fishermen gathered around the skiff, examining what was tied beside it. One fisherman stood in the water, his trousers rolled up, measuring the skeleton with a length of line. The boy did not join them, for one of the fishermen was looking after the skiff on his behalf. "How is he?" one of the fishermen shouted. "Sleeping," the boy called back. He did not mind that they saw him crying. "Let no one disturb him." "He was eighteen feet from nose to tail," the fisherman measuring him announced. "I believe it," the boy replied.

He entered the Terrace and requested a can of coffee. "Hot, with plenty of milk and sugar," he specified. "Anything else?" the proprietor inquired. "No. Later, I will see what he can eat." "What a fish it was," the proprietor remarked. "Never before has such a fish been seen. The two fine fish you caught yesterday were remarkable as well." "Curse my fish," the boy exclaimed, and he began to cry once more. "Would you like a drink of any kind?" the proprietor offered. "No," the boy replied. "Please inform them not to disturb Santiago. I will return." "Tell him how sorry I am," the proprietor said. "Thank you," the boy expressed his gratitude.

The boy carried the hot can of coffee up to the old man's shack and sat by his side until he awoke. There was a moment when it seemed as though he was stirring, but he slipped back into a deep slumber. The boy crossed the road to borrow some wood to heat the coffee.

Finally, the old man awakened. "Do not sit up," the boy advised. "Drink this."

He did pour some of the coffee in a glass.
The old man did take it and did drink it.
“They did beat me, Manolin,” he did say. “They truly did beat me.”
“He did not beat you. Not the fish.”
“No. Truly. It was afterwards.”
“Pedrico is looking after the skiff and the gear. What do you want done with the
head?”
“Let Pedrico chop it up to use in fish traps.”
“And the spear?”
“You keep it if you want it.”
“I want it,” the boy did say. “Now we must make our plans about the other things.”
“Did they search for me?”
“Of course. With coast guard and with planes.”
“The ocean is very big and a skiff is small and hard to see,” the old man did say. He
did notice how pleasant it was to have someone to talk to instead of speaking only to
himself and to the sea. “I missed you,” he did say. “What did you catch?” “One the first day.
One the second and two the third.”
[124] “Very good.”
“Now we fish together again.”
“No. I am not lucky. I am not lucky anymore.”
“The hell with luck,” the boy did say. “I’ll bring the luck with me.”
“What will your family say?”
“I do not care. I caught two yesterday. But we will fish together now for I still have
much to learn.”
“We must get a good killing lance and always have it on board. You can make the
blade from a spring leaf from an old Ford. We can grind it in Guanabacoa. It should be
sharp and not tempered so it will break. My knife broke.”
“I’ll get another knife and have the spring ground.”
How many days of heavy brisa have we?”
“Maybe three. Maybe more.”
“I will have everything in order,” the boy did say. “You get your hands well old man.”

"I know how to care for them. In the night I spat something strange and felt
something in my chest was broken." "Get that well too," the boy said. "Lie down, old man,
and I will bring you your clean shirt. And something to eat."
[125] "Bring any of the papers of the time that I was gone," the old man said.
"You must get well fast for there is much that I can learn and you can teach me
everything.
How much did you suffer?" "Plenty," the old man said.
"I'll bring the food and the papers," the boy said. "Rest well, old man. I will bring
stuff from the drugstore for your hands."
"Don't forget to tell Pedrico the head is his."
"No. I will remember."
As the boy went out the door and down the worn coral rock road he was crying again.
That afternoon there was a party of tourists at the Terrace and looking down in the
water among the empty beer cans and dead barracudas a woman saw a great long white
spine with a huge tail at the end that lifted and swung with the tide while the east wind
blew a heavy steady sea outside the entrance to the harbour.
"What's that?" she asked a waiter and pointed to the long backbone of the great fish
that was now just garbage waiting to go out with the tide.
"Tiburon," the waiter said. "Shark." He was meaning to explain what had happened.
"I didn't know sharks had such handsome, beautifully formed tails."
"I didn't either," her male companion said.
Up the road, in his shack, the old man was sleeping again. He was still sleeping on
his face and the boy was sitting by him watching him. The old man was dreaming about
the lions.
THE END.

“我知道如何照顾它们。在夜晚，我吐出了一些奇怪的东西，感觉到我的胸口有些断裂。” “也要把那个治好，”男孩说。“躺下，老人，我会给你拿来干净的衬衫。还有些吃的。”
[125] “把我离开的时候的报纸都拿来，”老人说。“你必须快点康复，因为有很多我可以学到的东西，你可以教我一切。”
“你受了多少苦？”“很多，”老人说。
“我会把食物和报纸都拿来的，”男孩说。“好好休息，老人。我会给你从药店带来一些东西给你的手。”
“别忘了告诉佩德里科，头是他的。”
“不会忘记的。”
男孩走出门，沿着磨损的珊瑚岩路走下去，他又哭了起来。
那天下午，露台上有一群游客，他们在空啤酒罐和死巴拉库达鱼中间往下看，一个女人看到了一根巨大的长白色脊椎骨，尾巴上有一条巨大的尾巴，随着潮水的起伏而摇摆，而东风吹着一片沉重而稳定的海浪，从港口的入口处吹来。
“那是什么？”她问一个服务员，指着那条巨鱼的长脊椎骨，现在只是等待潮水带走的垃圾。
“Tiburon，”服务员说。“鲨鱼。”他本意是解释发生了什么。
“我不知道鲨鱼有这样漂亮、完美的尾巴。”
“我也不知道，”她的男伴说。
在路上，老人的小屋里，他又睡着了。他还是趴着睡觉，男孩坐在他旁边看着他。老人正在梦见狮子。
结局。

The Old Man and the Sea Asiaing.com
Ernest Hemingway, Writer
• Born: 21 July 1899
• Birthplace: Oak Park, Illinois
• Died: 2 July 1961 (suicide)
• Best Known As: Famously manly author of For Whom the Bell
Tolls

Hemingway is one of the 20th century's most famous American writers. His
books include The Sun Also Rises (1926), A Farewell to Arms (1929), and For
Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). Hemingway's plainspoken no-frills writing style
became so famous that it was (and is) frequently parodied. His dashing
machismo was almost as famous as his writing: he lived in Paris, Cuba and Key
West, fancied bullfighting and big game hunting, and served as a war
correspondent in WWII and the Spanish Civil War. He sealed his own notoriety
when he killed himself with a shotgun in 1961.

Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954...

Hemingway is sometimes called by his familiar nickname "Papa"... His
birthdate is sometimes listed in error as 1898. According to a 1954 article in the
New York Times, "In most reference books and in his own conversation he is
one year older because he gave 1898 as his birth date when he tried to enlist [in
the army] early in 1917, and stuck to that date ever since"... Hemingway's father
also committed suicide, shooting himself with a Civil War pistol in 1928.

亚洲之海之老人
欧内斯特·海明威，作家
• 出生：1899年7月21日
• 出生地：伊利诺伊州奥克帕克
• 去世：1961年7月2日（自杀）
• 最著名作品：《为了谁的丧钟而鸣》

海明威是20世纪最著名的美国作家之一。他的作品包括《太阳照样升起》（1926年）、《永别了，武器》（1929年）和《为了谁的丧钟而鸣》（1940年）。海明威的平实无华的写作风格如此著名，以至于经常被模仿。他的英勇男子气概几乎和他的写作一样出名：他曾在巴黎、古巴和基韦斯特居住，热衷于斗牛和大型猎物狩猎，并在二战和西班牙内战中担任战地记者。他在1961年用霰弹枪结束了自己的生命，从而使自己成为众所周知的人物。

海明威于1954年获得诺贝尔文学奖...

海明威有时被称为他熟悉的绰号“爸爸”... 他的出生日期有时会错误地列为1898年。根据1954年《纽约时报》的一篇文章，“在大多数参考书和他自己的谈话中，他的年龄比实际年龄大一岁，因为他在1917年早期试图入伍时给出了1898年作为他的出生日期，并一直坚持这个日期”... 海明威的父亲也自杀身亡，于1928年用一把内战手枪射击自己。
