    "# Retrieval Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen in previous chapters how powerful [retrieval augmentation](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langchain-retrieval-augmentation/) and [conversational agents](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/langchain-agents/) can be. They become even more impressive when we begin using them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversational agents can struggle with data freshness, knowledge about specific domains, or accessing internal documentation. By coupling agents with retrieval augmentation tools we no longer have these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One the other side, using \"naive\" retrieval augmentation without the use of an agent means we will retrieve contexts with *every* query. Again, this isn't always ideal as not every query requires access to external knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merging these methods gives us the best of both worlds. In this notebook we'll learn how to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we must install the prerequisite libraries that we will be using in this notebook."

By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were reluctant to move to a system of electives. Their graduates were shut out of Harvard Law School for that reason. Notre Dame continued to grow over the years, adding more colleges, programs, and sports teams. By 1921, with the addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college to a university with five colleges and a professional law school.

The university\\'s graduate program has more than 50 master\\'s, doctoral and professional degree programs offered by the five schools, with the addition of the Notre Dame Law School and a MD-PhD program offered in combination with IU medical School. Notre Dame\\'s campus covers 1,250 acres in a suburban setting and it contains a number of recognizable landmarks, such as the Golden Dome, the \"Word of Life\" mural (commonly known as Touchdown Jesus), and the Basilica. The university counts approximately 120,000 alumni, considered among the strongest alumni networks among U.S. colleges. The university has many multi-disciplinary institutes devoted to research in varying fields, including the Medieval Institute, the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, the Kroc Institute for International Peace studies, and the Center for Social Concerns. Recent research includes work on family conflict and child development, genome mapping, the increasing trade deficit of the United States with China, studies in fluid mechanics, computational science and engineering, and marketing trends on the Internet. In 2014 the Notre Dame student body consisted of 12,179 students, with 8,448 undergraduates, 2,138 graduate and professional and 1,593 professional (Law, M.Div., Business, M.Ed.) students.
